Three in the morning. I realize this second, then this one, lhen
the next: I dnw up me balance sheet for each minute. And why
all this? &ra11Jt 1 was bom. It is a special type of sleeplessness
that produces the indicuncnt of birth.
"Ever since I was bom'"-that sina his a rcsomnce so dsadful to

There is of knowledge that strips wharcvcr do of

•eight and scope: for such knowledge, ewrythlng is without
iwU except itseJ£ Pure ro the point of abhorring even the notion
of an object, it translates that extreme science according to which
doing or not doing something comes down to the same thing
and is accom panied by an eqW!y extreme satis&ction: that p(
being able to rehearse, each time , the discovery that :any gcs�
perfo� is nor worth defending, that nothing is enh:ancal by
the merest vestige of substance, that "re2lity" falls within the
province of lunacy. Such knowledge deserves co be called
posthumous: it functions as if the knower wne alive and not
alive, a being and the memory of a being. '"It's al.mldy in the
put," he nys �bout all he achieves, even as he achieves it,
thereby fornrer destitute of the prr:smt.

We do not rush rowud death, we flee the acasuophe of birth,
survivors struggling to forget it. Far of death is mere ly the
projection into the future of a fear which dates back to our first
moment of life.
We arc rcl\1Ct211t, of course, tO treat binh as :a scourge: twit
not been inculcated as the sovereign good-have we not been
told that the worst at the end, not at the outset of our
came
lives? Yet evil, the real evil, is bthind, nor ahead of us. What
tseaped Jesus did nor escape Buddha: t•If dutc things did not
exist in the world, 0 disciples, the Perfect One would nor appear
in the world . • . ." And ahead of old age and death he pbces
the fact of birth, source of cve.ry infirmity, cvecy disaster.

We on endure any truth, however dcsuuctive, provided it
replaces everything, provided it affords as much vitality as the
hope for which it substitutes.

Nothing is a bctrtt proof of how &r humaruty Jus regressed than

whom birth still provokes mourning and Jamenmtions.

To defy heredity is to defy billions of ycus, to defy the finl cell.
There is a god at the outset, if not at the end, of every joy.
Never comfonable in the immediate, I am lured only by wlut

moments when I was not: the non-born.
Physical need of dishonor. How I should luve liked to be the
executioner's son!
What right have you to pray for me? I need no intercessor, I
shall manage altme. The pnyers of a wretch I might accept, but
no one else's, not even a saint's. I cannot bear your bothering
about my salvation. If I apprehend salvation and Ace it, your
prayers are merely
an
indiscretion. Invest them dscwhere; in
any
gods.
c:ase, we do not serve the same If mine are impotent, there
is every reason to believe yours are no less so. Even assuming
they arc as you imagine them, they would still bck the power to

Hesiod was the first to elaborate a philosophy of history. And
also laun ched the notion of decadence. By doing so, what a light
he casts on historia.l process! If. at the very outset, in the heart
of the post-Homeric world, he decided that humanity was in its
iron age, what would he have said a few centuries later-wlut
would he say today?
Except in periods clouded over by frivolity or utopia, man has
always believed himself on the threshold of the worst. Knowing
what he knew, by what miracle could he have unceuingly varied
his desi«s and his terrors?
When, just after the Fiest World War, electricity was instaledl in

Ideas arc unsuited to a final agony; they die, of course, but
without knowing how co die, whcros an event exists only with a
