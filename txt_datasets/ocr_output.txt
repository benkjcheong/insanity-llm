The Race of Lost Men

*

IN NORTHERN MExico, forty-eight hours from Mexico City,
there is a race of pure red Indians called the Tarahumara.
Forty thousand people are living there in a style that
predates the Flood. They are a challenge to this world in
which people talk so much about progress only because
they despair of progressing.

This race, which ought to be physically degenerate,
has for four hundred years resisted every force that has
come to attack it: civilization, interbreeding, war, winter,
animals, storms, and the forest. The Tarahumara live
naked in the winter in mountains that are made impass-
able by snow, in defiance of all medical theories. Commu-
nism exists among them in a feeling of spontaneous soli-
darity.

Incredible as it may seem, the Tarahumara Indians live
as if they were already dead. They do not see reality and
they draw magical powers from the contempt they have for
elvilization.

Sometimes they come to the cities, impelled by I know
not what desire to move, to see, as they say, how it is with
those who are mistaken. For them, to live in the city is to
be mistaken.

THE PEYOTE DANCE

They come with wives and children, making impossible
journeys which no animal would try to attempt.

To watch them unswervingly follow their course,
through torrents, ground that gives way, dense under-
growth, rock ladders, sheer walls, I cannot help thinking
that they have somehow retained the instinctive force of
gravitation of the first men.

*

On first encounter, the region of the Tarahumara ap-
pears inaccessible. At best, a few poorly marked trails that
every twenty yards seem to disappear under the ground.
When night falls one must stop, unless one is a red man,
for only a red man can see where to put his feet. When
the Tarahumara come down into the cities, they beg. In a
striking manner: they stop by the doors of houses and
turn their heads to the side with an air of sovereign con-
tempt. They seem to be saying: “Since you are rich, you
are a dog, I am better than you, I spit on you.”

Whether they are given anything or not, they always
leave after the same period of time. If they are given some-
thing, they do not say thank you. For in their eyes to give
to someone who has nothing is not even a duty; it is a law
of physical reciprocity which the White World has betrayed.
Their attitude seems to say: “In obeying the law, it is your-
self you are helping, so I do not have to thank you.”

The money obtained by begging is used to buy food for
the return trip, for in the Tarahumara forest it is hard to see
what might be the use of money.

THE RACE OF LOST MEN 5

This law of physical reciprocity which we call charity
the Indians observe naturally, and without a trace of pity.
Those who have nothing because they lost their harvest,
because their corn has burned, because their father left
them nothing, or for whatever reason which they have no
need to explain, arrive at dawn at the houses of those who
have something. Immediately the mistress of the house
brings them whatever she has. No one looks at anyone,
neither the one who gives nor the one who receives. After
he has eaten, the beggar leaves without thanking or look-
Ing at anyone.

*

The whole life of the Tarahumara revolves around the
erotic Peyote rite.

The root of the Peyote plant is hermaphroditic. It has,
us we know, the shape of the male and female sexual or-
gans combined. It is in this rite that the whole secret of
these savage Indians resides. To me, its force seemed to
he symbolized by the rasping stick, a piece of curved wood
covered with notches which, for whole nights, the Peyote
worcerers rhythmically scrape with little sticks. But the
strangest part is the way in which these sorcerers are
recruited. One day, an Indian will feel called to handle
the rasp. He goes to a sacred hiding place in the moun-
tains, where for thousands of years there has lain an in-
credible collection of rasps which other sorcerers have
buried. They are made of wood, the wood of warm soil, it
{s said. The Tarahumara will spend three years living on



--- Page 5 ---

this plantation of rasps and, at the end of the third year,
he returns—the possessor of the essential rite.

Such is the life of this strange people over whom no
civilization will ever gain control.

*

A Primeval Race

*

To visir the Tarahumara is to enter a world which is in-
credibly anachronistic and exists in defiance of this age.
As far as I am concerned, this is so much the worse for this
age. So it is that the Tarahumara call themselves, feel
themselves, believe themselves to be a Primeval Race, and
they prove this to be true in every possible way. A Primeval
Race: today no one remembers what this is, and if I had
not seen the Tarahumara, I might well have believed that
the expression contains a Myth. But in the Tarahumara
Sicrra many of the Great Ancient Myths come back to life.
The Tarahumara do not believe in God and the word
“God” does not exist in their language; but they worship a
transcendent principle of Nature which is Male and Fe-
male, as it should be. And they wear this principle on their
heads like Pharaoh Initiates. Yes, this headband with two
points which they use to encircle their hair indicates that
they still have in their blood the consciousness of a high
natural selection; that they feel themselves to be, and
that they are, a race connected to those forces, originally
both Male and Female, with which Nature did her creative
work,



--- Page 6 ---

THE PEYOTE DANCE

Similarly, Chinese who are initiated into the true tradi-
tions of their fathers also wear two braids down their
backs. And Moses, in his stone statues, has two horns pro-
truding from his forehead, one for the male on the right
side, the other for the female on the left; some Tarahu-
mara also wear their hair pulled back like horns. And this
recalls, along with the statues of Moses, certain Maya or
Totonac statues which have two points or two holes on the
forehead, but placed one above the other, like the vestiges
of an ocular system that has petrified.

Many Tarahumara Indians, whether because they do
not wish to discuss it or because they have forgotten what
it means, claim that this arrangement is the result of
chance, and that they use the headband simply to hold
their hair in place. But I have seen Tarahumara sewing
headbands so that the points would hang down; and most
importantly, I have seen the Peyote priests at the moment
they perform this rite, which is by nature male and fe-
male, throw their European hats on the ground and put
on the two-pointed headband, as if they wanted to show by
this gesture that they were entering the circle of Nature
with its two magnetic poles.

There is an undeniable initiation in this race; he who is
close to the forces of nature participates in its secrets. But
this initiation cuts both ways, so to speak. For if the Tara-
humara are physically strong like Nature, it is not because
they live close to Nature in a material sense, it is because
they are made of the same substance as Nature and be-
cause, like all authentic manifestations of Nature, they
are born of an original blend.

One might say that it is the natural Unconscious which

A PRIMEVAL RACE 9

not only repairs in them the damages of fatigue but also
Corrects those natural perversions of a great principle by
which they explain the existence of all infirmities. On the
one hand, they show their initiation by the signs which
they scatter in haunting profusion on the trees and the
rocks, and on the other hand they reveal it by their physi-
cal strength, their admirable resistance to fatigue, their
contempt for physical pain, injury, or illness.

It is false to say that the Tarahumara have no civiliza-
tion, when we have reduced civilization to mere physical
conveniences, to material commodities which the Tarahu-
mara race has always despised.

For although the Tarahumara do not know how to
work metals, although they are still at the stage of pikes
and arrows, although they plow with carved tree trunks
and sleep on the ground fully clothed, they have the high-
est idea of the philosophical movement of Nature. And
they have managed to capture the secrets of this move-
ment in their idea of Primal Numbers as successfully as
Pythagoras did. The truth is that the Tarahumara despise
the life of their bodies, and live only for their ideas—that
is, in a constant and quasi-magical communication with
the superior life of these ideas.

Each Tarahumara village is preceded by a cross, and
surrounded by crosses at the four cardinal points of the
mountain. It is not the cross of Christ, the Catholic cross,
it is the cross of Man quartered in space, Man with his
arms extended to the sides, invisible, nailed to the four
Cardinal points. In this the Tarahumara manifest an active
geometric idea of the world to which even the human
body is related.



--- Page 7 ---

THE PEYOTE DANCE

This means: Here geometric space is alive, it has pro-
duced the best there is, that is, Man.

The stone which each Tarahumara must, under pain of
death, place at the foot of the cross when he passes is not
a superstition but a technique of awareness.

This means: Mark the point. Take note. Be aware of the
contrary forces of life, for without this awareness you are
dead.

But the Tarahumara do not fear physical death: the
body, they say, is made to disappear; it is spiritual death
that they dread, but they do not dread it in a Catholic
sense, although the Jesuits have passed their way.

There exists among the Tarahumara Indians the tra-
dition of metempsychosis; and it is the loss of their Double
which they dread above all. Not to be aware of what one’s
Double is, is to risk losing it. It is to risk a kind of abstract
fall, beyond physical space, a wandering through the high
planetary regions of the disembodied human principle.

Evil, for thern, is not sin. To the Tarahumara, there is
no sin: evil is loss of consciousness. The high philosophi-
cal problems are more important to the Tarahumara than
the precepts of our Western morality.

For the Tarahumara are obsessed with philosophy; and
they are obsessed to the point of a kind of physiological
magic; with them there is no such thing as a wasted ges-
ture, a gesture that does not have an immediate philosoph-
ical meaning. The Tarahumara become philosophers in
exactly the way a small child grows up and becomes a
man; they are philosophers by birth.

And the headband with its two points down the back
signifies that they are of a race that was originally Male

A PRIMEVAL RACE II

and Female; but this headband has another meaning: a
historic meaning which is obvious. The Pouranas carry
the memory of a war which the Male and Female principles
in Nature waged, and human beings took part in this war
between the forces of the two opposing principles. The
partisans of the natural Male principle wore white, those
of the Female principle wore red; and it was from this
esoteric and sacred red that the Phoenicians, of Female
race, derived the idea of the purple which they later com-
mercialized.

If the Tarahumara wear headbands which are some-
times white and sometimes red, it is not to affirm the
duality of the two contrary forces, but to indicate that
within the Tarahumara race the Male and Female prin-
ciples of Nature exist simultaneously, and that the Tara-
humara have the benefit of their combined forces. In short,
they wear their philosophy on their heads, and this phi-
losophy reconciles the influence of the two contrary forces
in an equilibrium that partakes of the divine.

A Voyage to the Land

of the Tarahumara

THE MOUNTAIN OF SIGNS

THE LAND of the Tarahumara is full of signs, forms, and
natural effigies which in no way seem the result of chance
—as if the gods themselves, whom one feels everywhere
here, had chosen to express their powers by means of these
strange signatures in which the figure of man is hunted
down from all sides.

Of course, there are places on the earth where Nature,
moved by a kind of intelligent whim, has sculptured hu-
man forms. But here the case is different, for it is over
the whole geographic expanse of a race that Nature has
chosen to speak.

And the strange thing is that those who travel through
this region, as if seized by an unconscious paralysis, close
their senses in order to remain ignorant of everything.
When Nature, by a strange whim, suddenly shows the body
of a man being tortured on a rock, one can think at first
that this is merely a whim and that this whim signifies
nothing. But when in the course of many days on horse-

I2

A VOYAGE TO THE LAND OF THE TARAHUMARA 13

back the same intelligent charm is repeated, and when
Nature obstinately manifests the same idea; when the
same pathetic forms recur; when the heads of familiar
gods appear on the rocks, and when a theme of death
emanates from them, a death for which man obstinately
bears the expense—when the dismembered form of man
is answered by the forms of the gods who have always
tortured him, become less obscure, more separate from a
petrifying matter—when a whole area of the earth de-
velops a philosophy parallel to that of its inhabitants; when
one knows that the first men utilized a language of signs,
and when one finds this language formidably expanded
on the rocks, then surely one cannot continue to think
that this is a whim, and that this whim signifies noth-
ing.

If the greater part of the Tarahumara race is indigenous,
and if, as they claim, they fell out of the sky into the Sierra,
one may say that they fell into a Nature that was already
prepared, And this Nature chose to think like a man. Just
as she evolved men, she also evolved rocks.

This naked man who was being tortured, I saw him
nailed to a rock and worked on by forms which the sun
made volatile; but by I know not what optical miracle the
man up there remained whole, although he was in the
same light as they.

Between the mountain and myself I cannot say which
was haunted, but in my voyage across the mountain I
saw an optical miracle of this kind occur at least once a
day.

I may have been born with a tormented body—as much
a fake as the immense mountain, but a body whose ob-



--- Page 9 ---

sessions are useful—and I noticed in the mountain that
it is useful to have the obsession of counting. There was
not a shadow that I did not count, when I felt it creep
around something; and it was often by adding up shadows
that I found my way back to strange centers.

I saw in the mountain a naked man leaning out of a
large window. His head was nothing but a huge hole, a
kind of circular cavity in which the sun and moon ap-
peared by turns, according to the time of day. His right
arm was stretched out like a bar but drowned in shadows
and bent backward.

You could count his ribs, which numbered seven on
each side. In place of the navel glittered a shiny triangle,
made of what? I could not possibly say. As if Nature had
chosen this piece of the mountain to expose her buried
silica.

And although his head was empty, the indentations in
the rock all around him gave him a precise expression
in which the light made subtle changes as it advanced.

This right arm stretched forward and edged by a ray of
light did not indicate an ordinary direction . . . and I was
looking for what he was announcing!

It was not quite noon when I came upon this vision;
I was on horseback and I was moving quickly. However, I
was able to observe that what I was seeing was not sculp-
tured forms but a certain phenomenon of light which was
superimposed on the relief pattern of the rocks.

This figure was known to the Indians; it seemed to me
by its composition and structure to obey the same principle
that underlay the whole of this mountain of truncated

A VOYAGE TO THE LAND OF THE TARAHUMARA 15

forms. In the line of the arm there was a village surrounded
by a girdle of rocks.

And I saw that the rocks all had the shape of a woman’s
bosom with two perfectly delineated breasts.

I saw repeated eight times the same rock which pro-
jected two shadows on the ground; I saw twice the same
animal’s head carrying in its jaws its effigy which it de-
voured; I saw, dominating the village, a kind of enormous
phallic tooth with three stones at its summit and four holes
on its outer face; and from their beginning, I saw all these
shapes pass gradually into reality.

I seemed to read everywhere a story of childbirth in war,
a story of genesis and chaos, with all these bodies of gods
which were carved out like people; and these truncated
statues of human forms. Not one shape which was intact,
not one body which did not look as if it had emerged from
a recent massacre, not one group in which I was not forced
to read the struggle that divided it.

I discovered drowned men, half eaten away by the
stone, and on rocks above them, other men who were
struggling to keep them down. Elsewhere, an enormous
statue of Death held an infant in its hand.

There is in the Cabala a music of Numbers, and this
music, which reduces the chaos of the material world to
its principles, explains by a kind of awesome mathematics
how Nature is ordered and how she directs the birth of
the forms that she pulls out of chaos. And everything I saw
seemed to correspond to a number. The statues, the forms,
the shadows always presented the recurring numbers 3, 4,
7, 8. The broken-off busts of women numbered 8; the



--- Page 10 ---

16 THE PEYOTE DANCE

phallic tooth, as I said, had three stones and four holes;
the forms that became volatile numbered 12, etc. I repeat,
if someone says that these forms are natural, I shall not
argue; it is their repetition which is not natural. And what
is even less natural is that the forms of the landscape are
repeated by the Tarahumara in their rites and their dances.
And these dances are not the result of chance but obey
the same secret mathematics, the same concern for the
subtle relations of Numbers which governs the entire
Sierra region.

This inhabited Sierra, this Sierra which exhales a meta-
physical thinking in its rocks, the Tarahumara have cov-
ered with signs, signs that are completely conscious, in-
telligent, and purposeful.

At every bend in the road one sees trees that have de-
liberately been burned in the shape of a cross, or in the
shape of creatures, and often these creatures are double
and face each other, as if to manifest the essential duality
of things; and I have seen this duality reduced to its prin-
ciple in a sign in the shape ,, surrounded by a circle,
which I saw branded with a red-hot iron on a tall pine;
other trees bore spears, trefoils, or acanthus leaves sur-
rounded by crosses; here and there, in places with steep
embankments, narrow passageways between rocks, lines
of Egyptian anserated crosses grew into processions; and
the doors of the Tarahumara houses displayed the sign of
the Mayan world: two facing triangles with their points
connected by a bar; and this bar is the Tree of Life which
passes through the center of Reality.

As I travel through the mountain, these spears, these
crosses, these trefoils, these leafy hearts, these composite

A VOYAGE TO THE LAND OF THE TARAHUMARA 17

crosses, these triangles, these creatures facing each other
and opposing each other to mark their eternal conflict,
their division, their duality, awaken strange memories in
me. I remember suddenly that there were, in History, Sects
which inlaid these same signs upon rocks, carved out of
jade, beaten into iron, or chiseled. And I begin to think
that this symbolism conceals a Science. And I find it
strange that the primitive people of the Tarahumara tribe,
whose rites and culture are older than the Flood, actually
possessed this science well before the appearance of the
Legend of the Grail, or the founding of the Sect of the
Rosicrucians.

The Peyote Rite among

the Tarahumara

*

Ir was the priests of Tutuguri who showed me the way of
Ciguri, just as a few days earlier the Master of All Things
had shown me the way of Tutuguri. The Master of All
Things governs external relations between people: friend-
ship, pity, charity, loyalty, piety, generosity, work. His
power stops at the threshold of what is known in Europe
as metaphysics or theology, but it goes much further into
the realm of inner consciousness than that of any Euro-
pean political leader. In Mexico no one can be initiated,
that is, receive the unction of the priests of the Sun and
the immersive and reinstating blow of the priests of Ci-
guri, which is a rite of humiliation, unless he has previ-
ously been touched by the sword of the old Indian chief
who has authority over peace and war, over Justice, Mar-
riage, and Love. He seems to have control over those forces
which compel people to love each other or which drive
them mad, whereas the priests of Tutuguri invoke with
their mouths that Spirit which creates men and places
them in the Infinite from which the Soul must collect them
and rearrange them in its self..The influence of the priests

18

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 19
of the Sun surrounds the whole soul and stops at the
had shown me the way of Tutuguri. The Master of All
Things picks up the reverberation. And it was at this
boundary that the old Mexican chief struck me in order
to reawaken my consciousness, for to understand the Sun
I was not well born; for the hierarchical order of things
dictates that, after passing through the ALL, that is the
many, which is matter, one returns to the simplicity of the
one, which is Tutuguri or the Sun, only to dissolve and
be reborn by means of this process of mysterious reassimi-
lation. This dark reassimilation is contained within Ci-
guri, as a Myth of reawakening, then of destruction, and
finally of resolution in the sieve of supreme surrender, as
their priests are incessantly shouting and affirming in their
Dance of All the Night. For it lasts the entire night, from
sunset to dawn, but it takes the whole night and gathers
it as one gathers all the juice of a fruit at the very source
of life. And the eradication of ownership extends to god
and even beyond; for not even god, least of all god, can take
that part of the self which is authentically one’s own, how-
ever foolishly it may be abandoned.

It was on a Sunday morning that the old Indian chief
awakened my consciousness with a prick of the sword
between the spleen and the heart. “Have confidence,” he
said to me, “have no fear, I will do you no harm,” and he
quickly retreated three or four steps and, after describing
a circle in the air behind him with his sword, rushed for-
ward and leaped at me with all his strength, as if he meant
to destroy me. But the point of his sword barely grazed my
skin and drew only a tiny drop of blood. I felt no pain
whatsoever, but I did have the impression of awakening



--- Page 12 ---

20 THE PEYOTE DANCE

to something for which until then I had been ill endowed
and ill prepared, and I felt filled with a light which I had
never before possessed. It was a few days later that one
morning at dawn I entered into relation with the priests
of Tutuguri and two days after that that I finally made
contact with Ciguri.

“To sew you back together in your wholeness, without
God who assimilates you and creates you, as if you were
creating yourself, and as you yourself create yourself out
of Nothingness and in spite of Him at every moment.”

These are the very words of the Indian chief and I am
merely reporting them, not as he said them to me, but as
I have reconstructed them under the fantastic illumina-
tions of Ciguri.

Now if the Priests of the Sun behave like manifestations
of the Word of God, or of his Logos, that is, Jesus Christ,
the Priests of Peyote allowed me to experience the actual
Myth of the Mystery, to become immersed in the original
mythic arcana, to enter through them into the Mystery of
Mysteries, to look upon the face of those extreme opera-
tions by which THE FATHER MAN, NEITHER MAN NOR
woman, created all things. To be sure I did not catch ail
this immediately and it took me a while to understand it,
and indeed, many of the dance movements, many of the
attitudes or the shapes which the priests of Ciguri draw in
the air as if they were imposing them on the darkness or
drawing them from the caves of night, they themselves
do not understand, and in performing them they are merely
obeying on the one hand a kind of physical tradition, and
on the other the secret commands issued to them by the
Peyote whose essence they absorb before they start danc-

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 21

ing, in order to achieve a trance state. I mean that they
do what the plant tells them to do; they repeat it like a
kind of lesson which their muscles obey, but which they
no longer understand in the relaxation of their nerves, any
more than their fathers or grandfathers before them. For
the function of every nerve is strained. This did not satisfy
me and when the Dance was over I wanted to find out
more. For before witnessing the Rite of Ciguri as it is per-
formed by living Indian priests, I had questioned many
Tarahumara on the mountain and had spent the night
with a young family of whom the husband was an adept
of this rite and seemed to know many of its secrets. And
I received from him some marvelous explanations and
extremely precise elucidations of the way in which Peyote
revives throughout the nervous system the memory of
certain supreme truths by means of which human con-
sciousness does not lose but on the contrary regains its
perception of the Infinite. “The nature of these truths,” this
man told me, “it is not my business to show you. But it is
my business to reawaken them in the mind of your human
existence. The mind of man is tired of God, because it is
bad and sick, and it is up to us to make it hungry for Him.
But as you see, Time itself refuses us the means. You will
be shown tomorrow what we still can do. And if you wish
to work with us, perhaps with the aid of the Good Will of
a man who has come from the other side of the sea and
who is not of our Race, we shall succeed in breaking down
one more barrier.” cicuRi is a name which Indian ears do
not like to hear pronounced. I had with me a mestizo guide
who also acted as my interpreter with the Tarahumara,
and he had warned me to mention it to them only with



--- Page 13 ---

22 THE PEYOTE DANCE

respect and caution because, he told me, they are afraid
of it. But I observed that if there is any emotion that is
alien to them in this connection it is fear, and that, on the
contrary, the word awakens in them that sense of the
sacred which European consciousness has lost, and this
is the root of all our misfortunes, for here people no
longer respect anything. And the series of attitudes the
young Indian assumed before my eyes when I uttered the
word cicuRI taught me many things about the potentiali-
ties of human consciousness when it has retained the
sense of God. I will admit that a terror emanated from
his gestures, but the terror was not his own, for it covered
him as if with a shield or a mantle. He seemed happy as
one is only in the supreme moments of existence, his face
overflowing with joy and adoration. So must they have
stood, the First Born of a humanity still in childbirth when
the spirit of MAN UNCREATED rose in thunder and flames
over the eviscerated world; so must they have prayed in
the catacombs, those skeletons to whom it is written that
MAN himself appeared.

He joined his hands and his eyes kindled. His face be-
came transfixed and closed. But the more he withdrew into
himself, the more I had the impression that a strange and
legible emotion radiated physically from him. He moved
two or three times. And each time his eyes, which had be-
come almost fixed, returned to a point next to him, as if he
wanted to be aware of something that was to be feared.
But I realized that what he might be afraid of was falling
short of the respect he owed to God, through some sort of
negligence. And I observed two very important things: the
first was that the Tarahumara Indian does not attach the

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 23

same value to his body that we Europeans do, and that he
has an entirely different notion of it. “It isn’t I at all,” he
seemed to say, “who am this body,” and when he turned to
stare at something next to him it was his body itself that
he seemed to examine and observe.

“Where I am myself and what I am, it is Ciguri who tells
it to me and dictates it to me, and you who lie and disobey.
What I feel in reality you are never willing to feel, and
you give me contrary sensations. You want nothing of
what I want. And what you propose to me most of the time
is Evil. You have been nothing but a transitory ordeal and
a burden. Someday I shall command you to leave when
Ciguri himself will be free, but,” he said suddenly, weeping,
“you must not leave altogether. It was Ciguri, after all,
who made you and many times you have provided me with
a refuge from the storm, for Ciguri would die if he did not
have me.”

The second thing I observed in the middle of this prayer
—for this series of movements in front of himself and as
if beside himself which I had just witnessed, and which
took much less time to. perform than I have taken to re-
port it, constituted the Indian’s impromptu prayer at the
mere sound of the name Ciguri—the second thing that
struck me is that if the Indian is the enemy of his body,
he seems also to have sacrificed his consciousness to God,
and it seems that the habit of Peyote guides him in this
work. The emotions which radiated from him, which passed
across his face one after the other, and which could be
read, were manifestly not his own; he did not attribute
them to himself, he no longer identified with what for us
is a personal emotion, or rather he did not do it in our



--- Page 14 ---

24 THE PEYOTE DANCE

way, as the result of a choice and of an instant flashing
incubation as we do. Among all the ideas that pass through
our heads there are those we accept and those we do
not accept. On the day when our self and our conscious-
ness are formed there is established within this incessant
movement of incubation a distinctive rhythm and a nat-
ural choice whereby only our own ideas remain in the
field of consciousness, and the rest automatically vanish.
It may take us time to carve out of our emotions and iso-
late from them our own face, but the way we think on the
most important points is like the totem of an indisputable
grammar that measures its terms word for word. And our
self, when we question it, always responds in the same
way: like someone who knows that it is he who answers
and not another. It is not like this with the Indian.

A European would never allow himself to think that
something he has felt and perceived in his body, an emotion
which has shaken him, a strange idea which he has just
had and which has inspired him with its beauty, was not
his own, and that someone else has felt and experienced
all this in his own body—or else he would believe himself
mad and people would probably say that he had become
a lunatic. The Tarahumara, on the contrary, systematically
distinguishes between what is his own and what is of the
Other in everything he thinks, feels, and does. But what
makes him different from a lunatic is that his personal
consciousness has expanded in this process of internal
separation and distribution to which Peyote has led him
and which strengthens his will. Although he may seem to
know what he is not much better than what he is, he does
know what he is and who he is much better than we know

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 25

what we are and what we want. “There is,” he said, “in
every man an ancient reflection of God in which we can
still contemplate the image of that infinite force which one
day flung us into a soul and this soul into a body, and it is
to the image of this Force that Peyote has led us because
Ciguri calls us back to him.”

What I observed of this Indian who had not taken Peyote
for a long time, but was one of the adepts of its Rites—
for the Rite of Ciguri is the summit of the religion of the
Tarahumara—instilled in me the greatest desire to see all
these Rites myself and to obtain permission to participate
in them. That was the difficult part.

The friendliness shown me by this young Tarahumara
who was not afraid to start praying a few feet away from
me was already a guarantee that certain doors would be
opened. Moreover, what he had said about the help that
was expected from me made me think that my admission
to the Rites of Ciguri depended partly on what I could do
to overcome the resistance the Tarahumara were encoun-
tering from the mestizo government of Mexico to the ob-
servance of their Rites. Although mestizo, this government
is pro-Indian because those who hold office have more
red blood than white. But the distribution is not propor-
tionate, and government representatives in the mountains
are almost wholly of mixed blood. And they regard the
beliefs of the Old Mexicans as dangerous. The present
government of Mexico has founded native schools in the
mountains where Indian children are given an instruction
patterned after that of French elementary schools, and the
head of the Department of Public Education of Mexico,
from whom the French ambassador had obtained a permit

for me, gave me lodgings in the native school of the Tara-
humara. Thus I had made the acquaintance of the director
of this school, who was also in charge of discipline through-
out the Tarahumara territory, and who had under him a
division of cavalry. Although no steps had yet been taken
in the matter, I knew that the official intention was to pro-
hibit the next Peyote celebration, which was to take place
in a few days. In addition to the great Racial Festival in
which all the Tarahumara participate and which takes
place at a fixed date, like our Christmas, the Tarahumara
also have a number of special Rites based on Peyote. And
they had consented to show me one of these. In the reli-
gion of the Tarahumara there are other holidays, just as
here we have Easter, the Feast of the Ascension, the Feast
of the Assumption, and the Feast of the Immaculate Con-
ception, but they do not all involve Peyote, and the Great
Feast of Ciguri takes place, I believe, only once a year. It
is then that it is taken according to all the age-old tradi-
tional rites. Peyote is also taken on the other holidays but
only as an occasional adjuvant and with no attention to
graduating its force or effects. When I say that Peyote is
taken I ought rather to say that it was taken, because the
Mexican government is doing everything in its power to
take Peyote away from the Tarahumara and to prevent
their coming under its influence, and soldiers sent by the
government into the mountains have received orders to
prevent its cultivation. On my arrival in the mountains I
found the Tarahumara desperate because of the recent
destruction of a field of Peyote by the soldiers of Mexico
City.

Thad a long conversation on this subject with the director

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 27

of the native school where I stayed. This conversation was
heated, difficult, and sometimes repugnant. The mestizo
director of the Tarahumara native school was much more
preoccupied with his sex, which enabled him each night
to possess the schoolmistress, a mestizo like himself, than
with culture or religion. But the government of Mexico
had based its program on a return to Indian culture and
in spite of everything the man was reluctant to shed In-
dian blood.

“cicuRI,” I told him, “is not a plant, it is a man whom
you have castrated by blowing up the Peyote field. And
for this red and mutilated member which sings—green,
white, lilac—the people want to call you to account. And
they see it.” I noticed as I passed through several Tara-
humara villages that a wind of revolt was blowing over
the tribe at the appearance of the red member. The di-
rector of the native school was not unaware of this, but
he was undecided about what method to use to restore
calm among the Indians. “The only method,” I told him,
“is to succeed in winning their hearts. They will never for-
give you for this destruction, but you can show them by
an opposite action that you are not an enemy of God. You
are only a handful here and if they decided to revolt you
would have to make war on them, and even with your
weapons you could not hold out. Besides, the Priests of
Ciguri have hiding places where you will never be able to
go.

“And what would become of the return of Mexico to
Indian culture in the face of civil war? You must authorize
this Festival at once if you want to have any Tarahumara
left, and you must also provide the tribes with facilities

for gathering, so that they will feel that you are sympathetic
to them.”

“The trouble is that when they have taken Peyote, they
no longer obey us.”

“It is the same with Peyote as it is with everything
human. It is a marvelous magnetic and alchemical prin-
ciple, provided one knows how to take it—that is to say,
in the proper doses and according to the proper gradations.
And above all, provided one does not take it at the wrong
time or in the wrong place. If after taking Peyote the In-
dians seem to go mad, it is because they are abusing it
in order to reach that point of disorderly intoxication in
which the soul is no longer subject to anything. In so
doing, it is not you whom they are disobeying but Ciguri
itself, for Ciguri is the God of the Prescience of the just, of
equilibrium and of self-control. He who has truly imbibed
Ciguri, the true meter and measure of Ciguri, MAN and
not indeterminate PHANTOM, knows how things are made
and he can no longer lose his reason, because it is God
who is in his nerves and who guides them.

“But to drink Ciguri is by definition not to exceed the
dose, for Ciguri is the Infinite, and the mystery of the
therapeutic action of remedies is related to the ‘proportion
in which our organism takes them. To exceed what is neces-
sary is to VIOLATE that action.

“According to the sacerdotal traditions of the Tarahu-
mara, God disappears immediately when one has taken
too much and in his place it is the Evil Spirit who comes.”

“Tomorrow evening you will make the acquaintance of
a family of Priests of Ciguri,” said the director of the na-
tive school. “Tell them what you just told me and I am

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 29

sure that this time again and perhaps more than the last
few times we shall succeed in keeping the absorption of
Peyote within bounds. Tell them also that this Feast will be
authorized and that we will do everything in our power to
make the gathering possible and that to this end we shall
provide them with whatever horses and supplies they may
need.”

In the late afternoon of the next day I arrived at the
little Indian village where I had been told that the Rite of
Peyote was to be shown me. It took place after dark. The
priest arrived with two assistants, a man and a woman,
and two young children. He drew on the ground a kind of
large semicircle inside which the revels of his assistants
were to take place and he closed this semicircle with a
stout beam on which I was permitted to sit. To the right,
the arc of the circle was bounded by a kind of retreat in
the shape of an 8 which I understood constituted for the
priest the Holy of Holies. To the left, there was the Void:
this is where the children stood. It was in the Holy of Holies
that the old wooden pot containing the Peyote roots was
placed, for the Priests do not use the whole plant for their
special Rites, or at least not any more.

The Priest had a cane in his hand and the children had
little sticks. Peyote is taken after a certain number of
dance movements and when, by the religious performance
of the Rite, its adepts have achieved a state in which Ci-
guri wishes to enter into them.

I observed that the assistants were having trouble start-
ing to move, and I had the impression that they would not
dance or would dance badly if they did not know that at
the appropriate moment Ciguri was going to descend upon



--- Page 17 ---

THE PEYOTE DANCE

go

them. For the Rite of Ciguri is a Rite of creation, which
explains how things are in the Void and how the Void is
in the Infinite, and how they emerged from it into Reality,
and were made. And the Rite is completed at the moment
when, at God’s command, the things have taken on Being
in a body. This is what the two assistants danced, but this
did not take place without a long discussion.

“We can no longer understand God unless he first touches
our souls, and our dance will be nothing but a mockery,
and the PHANToM,” they screamed, “the PHANTOM which
pursues cicuRt will be born here once again.”

The Priest took a long time making up his mind, but
finally he drew from his breast a small bag and poured into
the Indians’ hands a kind of white powder which they im-
mediately consumed.

Whereupon they began to dance. Seeing their faces after
they had taken this powdered Peyote, I realized that they
were going to show me something which I had never ex-
perienced before. And I gave all my attention so that I
would miss nothing of what I was going to see.

The two assistants lay down on the ground facing each
other like two inanimate balls. But the old Priest must
have taken the powder himself, for an inhuman expression
had stolen over his face. I saw him stretch and stand very
tall. His eyes kindled and began to take on an expression
of unusual authority. With his cane he made two or three
dull thuds on the ground, then entered the 8 he had drawn
to the right of the Ritual Field. Now the assistants seemed
to emerge from their inanimate state. First the man shook
his head and struck the ground with the palms of his
hands. The woman shook her back. Then the Priest spat:

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 31

not saliva, but his breath. Noisily he expelled his breath
between his teeth. Under the influence of this pulmonary
vibration, the man and woman simultaneously came to life
and rose to their feet. But from the way they stood facing
each other, especially from the way each stood in space as
they might have stood in the pockets of the void and the
cracks of the infinite, it was clear that it was no longer a
man and a woman who were there but two principles: the
male, mouth open, gums smacking, red, flaming, bloody,
as if lacerated by the roots of the teeth, which were trans-
lucent at that moment like tongues of command; the fe-
male, toothless larva, molars filed down, like a she-rat in
its cage, imprisoned in her own heat, shifting and turning
in front of the hirsute male; and it was also clear that they
were going to collide, smash frantically into one another
just as material things, after facing each other for a time
and making war, finally intermingle before the indiscreet
and guilty eye of God, whom their action will gradually
replace. “For Ciguri,” they say, “was MAN, MAN aS SELF-
CREATED, HIMSELF in the space HE was constructing FOR
HIMSELF, when God murdered him.”

This is exactly what took place.

But one thing struck me particularly in the way they
threatened each other, avoided each other, collided with
each other, and finally consented to unite. This is that
these principles were not in the body, never reached the
body, but obstinately remained like two immaterial ideas
suspended outside of Being, eternally opposed to HIM, and
which moreover made their own bodies, bodies in which
the idea of matter is volatilized by cicuri. As I watched
them, I remembered everything I had been told about



--- Page 18 ---

32 THE PEYOTE DANCE

Indian religion and culture by the poets, teachers, and
artists of all kinds whom I knew in Mexico, and what I
had read in all the books I had borrowed about the meta-
physical traditions of the Mexicans.

“The Evil Spirit,” say the Initiate Priests of Ciguri,
“has never been able or willing to believe that God is not
accessibly and exclusively a Being and that there is some-
thing more than Being in the inscrutable essence of God.”

But this was exactly what this Peyote Dance was in the
process of showing me.

For in this dance I thought I could see the point where
the universal unconscious is sick. And that it is outside of
God. The priest would touch his spleen or his liver with his
right hand while with his left hand he struck the ground
with his cane. Each of his gestures evoked from the man
and the woman a distant attitude—now of desperate and
haughty affirmation, now of enraged denial. But when the
Priest, who now held his cane in both hands, struck several
rapid blows, they advanced rhythmically toward each other
with their elbows apart and their hands joined, so that
they formed two triangles in motion. At the same time
their feet drew on the ground circles, and something that
resembled the limbs of a letter, an S, a U, aJ, a V. Figures
in which the 8 shape recurred most often. Once, twice
they did not meet but passed one another with a tentative
greeting. The third time their greeting became more cer-
tain. The fourth time they joined hands, circled each other,
and the man’s feet seemed to search on the ground for
the places where the womans feet had struck it.

They repeated this sequence eight times. But after the
fourth time their faces, which had taken on a lively ex-

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 33

pression, never ceased to be radiant. The eighth time they
looked toward the Priest, who then moved with a domi-
nating and menacing air to the furthest end of the Holy of
Holies, where things are in contact with the North. And
with his cane he drew in the air a huge 8. But the scream
that he uttered at that moment could have overthrown the
hellish labor pains of the dead man black with his ancient
sin, in the words of the old buried poem of the Maya of
Yucatan; and I do not remember ever in my life hearing
anything that revealed more clearly or resonantly to what
depths the human will descends to raise its foreknowledge
of night. And I seemed to see again in the Infinite and as
if in a dream the raw matter from which God called forth
Life. This scream of the Priest seemed meant to sustain
the path of the cane in the air. Screaming this way, the
Priest moved and he drew with his whole body in the air
and with his feet on the ground the shape of the same 8
until he had closed the figure at the Southern end.

The dance was almost over. The two children who had
remained to the left of the circle all this time asked whether
they could go, and the Priest gave them a sign with his
cane as if to scatter and disappear. But neither of the two
had taken Peyote. They made a vague gesture that resem-
bled a dance movement, then gave up and disappeared as
if to go home.

*

As I said at the beginning of this account, all this did not
satisfy me. I wanted to find out more about Peyote. I walked
over to the Priest to question him.



--- Page 19 ---

34 THE PEYOTE DANCE

“Our last Festival,” he told me, “could not take place.
We are discouraged. Nowadays we do not take Ciguri for
the Rites but as a vice. Soon our whole Race will be sick.
Time has grown too old for Man. It can no longer sustain
us. What are we to do, what is to become of us? Already
our people are turning away from God. As a priest, I can-
not help feeling it. You see me in despair.”

I told him about the agreement that had been made with
the director of the native school and that this time their
next great festival could take place.

I also told him that I had not come to visit the Tara-
humara as a tourist but to regain a Truth which the world
of Europe is losing and which his Race had preserved. This
disarmed him completely and he told me some wonderful
things about Good and Evil, about Truth and Life.

“Everything I say comes from Ciguri,” he told me, “and
it was Ciguri that taught it to me.

“Things are not as we see them and experience them
most of the time, but they are as Ciguri teaches them to
us. They have been taken over by Evil, by the Evil Spirit
since time began, and without Ciguri it is impossible for
man to return to the Truth. In the beginning they were
true, but the older we grow the more false they become,
because the more they are taken over by Evil. The world
in the beginning was completely real, it resounded in the
human heart and with the human heart. Now the heart is
no longer in it, nor is the soul because God has withdrawn
from it. To see the things of the world was to see the In-
finite. Now when I look at the light I have trouble thinking
of God. And yet it is He, Ciguri, who made everything.
But Evil is in all things and I, as a man, can no longer feel

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 35

pure. There is inside me something horrible which rises
and which does not come from me, but from the shadows
that I have in me, where the soul of man does not know
where the I begins and where it ends, or what made it
begin as it sees itself. And this is what Ciguri tells me.
With Ciguri I no longer know untruth and I no longer
confuse that which wills truly in every man with that
which does not will but mimics being with ill will. And
soon that is all there will be,” he said, retreating several
steps: “this obscene mask of someone sniggering between
the sperm and the dung.”

These words of the Priest which I have just reported are
absolutely authentic; I found them too important and too
beautiful to allow myself to change them in any way, and
if I have not reported them word for word the difference
is very slight, for you must understand that they impressed
me profoundly and that my recollection on this point has
remained extremely precise. As I said before, he had just
taken Peyote and I was not surprised at his lucidity.

When this conversation was over he asked me whether
I would like to taste Ciguri myself and in this way to come
closer to the Truth I was seeking.

I told him that this was my fondest desire and that I did
not think that without the help of Peyote one could reach
everything which eludes us and from which we are be-
coming more and more alienated by time and material
things.

Into my left hand he poured a quantity the size of a
ripe almond, “enough,” he said, “to see God two or three
times, for God can never be known. To enter into his pres-
ence one must come under the influence of Ciguri at least



--- Page 20 ---

36 THE PEYOTE DANCE

three times, but each dose must not exceed the size of a
pea.”

So I spent another day or two among the Tarahumara
to deepen my experience of Peyote, and it would require a
large volume to report everything I saw and felt under its
influence and everything that the priests, their assistants,
and their families told me on the subject. But a vision
which I had and which impressed me was declared au-
thentic by the Priest and his family; it concerned, appar-
ently, the one who must be Ciguri and who is God. But one
arrives at such a vision only after one has gone through a
tearing and an agony, after which one feels as if turned
around and reversed to the other side of things, and one
no longer understands the world that one has just left.

I said reversed to the other side of things, as if a terrible
force had granted that you be restored to that which exists
on the other side. You no longer feel the body which you
have just left and which secured you within its limits, but
you feel much happier to belong to the limitless than to
yourself, for you understand that what was yourself has
come from the head of this limitless, the Infinite, and that
you are going to see it. You feel as if you were in an ef-
fervescent wave which gives off an incessant crackling in
all directions. Things which seem to have emerged from
what was your spleen, your liver, your heart, or your lungs
keep breaking away and bursting in this atmosphere which
wavers between gas and water, but which seems to sum-
mon forth material things and command them to combine.

The things that emerged from my spleen or my liver
were shaped like the letters of a very ancient and mysteri-
ous alphabet chewed by an enormous mouth, but terrify-

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 37

ingly obscure, proud, illegible, jealous of its invisibility;
and these signs were swept in all directions in space while
I seemed to ascend, but not alone. Aided by a strange
force. But much freer than when on the earth I was alone.

At a given moment something like a wind arose and
space shrank back. On the side where my spleen was, an
immense void was hollowed out which was painted gray
and pink like the shore of the sea. And at the bottom of
this void there appeared the form of a stranded root, a kind
of J that had at its summit three branches surmounted by
an E that was as sad and luminous as an eye. Flames
came out of the left ear of the J and, passing behind it,
seemed to push all things to the right, to the side where
my liver was, but far beyond it. I saw no more and every-
thing vanished or it was I who vanished as I returned to
ordinary reality. In any case, it seems that I had seen the
very Spirit of Ciguri. And I believe that this must have
objectively corresponded to a painted transcendental rep-
resentation of the ultimate and highest realities; and the
Mystics must go through similar states and images before
they reach, according to the formula, the supreme burn-
ings and rendings after which they fall beneath the kiss
of God like whores, no doubt, into the arms of their pro-
curers.

This experience inspired a number of reflections on the
psychic effects of Peyote.*

*T mean that although these mystical ideas may once again im-
pose themselves on my thinking, Peyote, on the other hand, does not
lend itself to these fetid spiritual assimilations, for mysTrc1sM has
never been anything but the copulation of a very learned and refined
hypocrisy against which peyorE as a whole protests, for with Peyote


--- Page 21 ---

38 THE PEYOTE DANCE

Peyote leads the self back to its true sources. Once one
has experienced a visionary state of this kind, one can no
longer confuse the lie with the truth. One has seen where
one comes from and who one is, and one no longer doubts
what one is. There is no emotion or external influence that
can divert one from this reality.

And the whole series of lustful fantasies projected by
the unconscious can no longer oppress the true breath of
MAN, for the good reason that Peyote is MAN not born, but
INBORN, and that with it the atavistic and personal con-
sciousness is summoned and supported. It knows what is
good for it and what is of no use to it: it knows which
thoughts and feelings it can receive without danger and
with profit, and which are harmful to the exercise of its
freedom. Above all, it knows just how far its own be-
ing goes, and just how far it has not yet gone OR HAS NOT
THE RIGHT TO GO WITHOUT SINKING INTO THE UNREAL, THE
ILLUSORY, THE UNMADE, THE UNPREPARED,

To take one’s dreams for realities (a state into which
Peyote will never let you sink) is where one might con-
fuse perceptions taken from the depths—fleeting, unculti-
vated, not yet ripe, not yet arisen from the hallucinatory
unconscious—with the images and emotions of the real.
For there is in consciousness a Magic with which one can
go beyond things. And Peyote tells us where this Magic
is, and after what strange concretions, whose breath is
MAN is alone, desperately scraping out the music of his own skeleton,
without father, mother, family, love, god, or society.

And no living being to accompany him. And the skeleton is not of
bone but of skin, like a skin that walks. And one walks from the

equinox to the solstice, buckling on one’s own humanity. [Note added
by Artaud in 1947.]

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 39

atavistically compressed and obstructed, the Fantastic can
emerge and can once again scatter in our consciousness
its phosphorescence and its haze. And this Fantastic is of
noble quality, its disorder is only apparent, it really obeys
an order that is fashioned mysteriously and on a level
which normal consciousness does not reach but which
Ciguri allows us to reach, and which is the very mystery of
all poetry. But there is in human existence another level,
obscure and formless, where consciousness has not entered,
and which surrounds it like a mysterious extension or a
menace, as the case may be. And which itself gives off ad-
venturous sensations, perceptions. These are those shame-
less fantasies which affect an unhealthy mind, which aban-
dons itself to them and dissolves in them completely if it
finds nothing to hold it back. And Peyote is the only barrier
that Evil encounters on this terrible frontier.

I too have had false sensations and perceptions and I
have believed in them. In June, July, August, and early
September last year I believed that I was surrounded by
demons, and I thought I could feel them, could see them
taking shape around me. The only way I could drive them
away was to keep making the sign of the cross over every
point on my body or in space where I thought I saw them.
I would also write on any scrap of paper or book within
reach, incantations which were not worth much either
from a literary point of view or as magic, for things writ-
ten in this state are no more than the residue, the distor-
tion, or rather the counterfeit of the high illuminations of
LIFE. By the end of last September these bad ideas, these
false ideas, these obsessive and inherently worthless per-
ceptions began to disappear; by October they were virtually



--- Page 22 ---

40 THE PEYOTE DANCE

gone. Around the 15th or 20th of last November I felt my
energy and my lucidity coming back. Above all, I felt that
my mind was finally clear. No more erroneous sensations.
No more bad perceptions. Now with every day a sense of
security, of inner certainty, is slowly but surely growing
within me.

If I have recently made gestures which resemble those
of certain victims,of religious mania, they are merely the
residue of the regrettable habits I adopted because of be-
liefs which did not exist. As the sea when it withdraws
leaves on the sand a varied deposit which the wind sweeps
away, I have for several weeks concentrated all my will
power on ridding myself of these little remnants. And I
observe that they are gradually disappearing.

There is one thing which the Peyote priests of Mexico
helped me to notice, and which the small amount of Peyote
I took brought to my consciousness. This is that in the
human liver there occurs that secret alchemy and that
process by which the self of each individual chooses what
suits it from among the sensations, emotions, and desires
which the unconscious shapes and which make up its ap-
petites, its conceptions, its true beliefs, and its ideas. It is
here that the I becomes conscious and that its power of
deliberation, of extreme organic discrimination, is de-
ployed. Because it is here that Ciguri works to separate
what exists from what does not exist. The liver seems,
therefore, to be the organic filter of the Unconscious.

I have found similar metaphysical ideas in the works of
the ancient Chinese. According to them the liver is the
filter of the unconscious but the spleen is the physical
counterpart of the infinite. But that is another matter.

THE PEYOTE RITE AMONG THE TARAHUMARA 41

But in order for the liver to perform its function it is
necessary at least that the body be well nourished.

One cannot reproach a man who has been shut up in
an insane asylum for six years and who for three years
has not had enough to eat for some mysterious weakening
of the Will. I sometimes go for months without eating a
piece of sugar or chocolate. As for butter, I have forgot-
ten how long it has been since I tasted it.

I never get up from the table without a feeling of hunger
because rations, as you know, are greatly reduced.

And, above all, there is not enough bread. Before the
piece of chocolate which was given to me the day before
yesterday, Friday, I had not eaten chocolate for eight
months. I am not a man who allows himself to be diverted
from doing his duty by anything, but at least let me not be
reproached for lack of energy in times like these, when
those elements which are necessary to the renewal of
energy no longer exist in the nourishment we receive. And,
above all, let me not be subjected to more electric-shock
treatments for lapses which it is well known are not beyond
the control of my own will, lucidity, and intelligence.
Enough, enough, and more than enough of this trauma of
punishment.

Each electric-shock treatment plunged me into a terror
which always lasted several hours. And I could not face
each new treatment without despair, for I knew that once
again I would lose consciousness and that for one whole
day I would be gasping for air inside myself, unable to
find myself, knowing perfectly well that I was somewhere
but the devil knew where, as if I were dead.

All this has taken us far from healing by Peyote. Accord-



--- Page 23 ---

THE PEYOTE DANCE

ing to what I saw, Peyote fixes the mind and prevents it
from wandering, from surrendering to false impressions.
The Mexican Priests showed me the exact point on the
liver where Ciguri or Peyote produces this synthetic con-
cretion which maintains permanently in the mind a sense
of and a desire for the real and gives it the strength to sur-
render to that while automatically rejecting the rest.

“It is like the skeleton leader who returns,” the Tara-
humara said of that DARK RITE, “THE NIGHT WHICH
MARCHES ON THE NIGHT.”

Post-script

*

The Peyote Rite was written in Rodez during the first year
of my arrival at the asylum, after I had already been shut
up for seven years, three of them in solitary confinement,
with systematic and daily poisoning. It represents my first
effort to return to myself after seven years of estrangement
and total castration. In it a recent victim of poisoning,
sequestered and traumatized, recalls what happened before
his death. This explains why the text can do no more than
stammer. I should add that it was written in the dulled
mental state of a convert whom the magical spells of the
priestly rabble, taking advantage of his momentary weak-
ness, were keeping in a state of enslavement.
Iury-sur-Seine, March 10, 1947

I wrote The Peyote Rite in a state of conversion, and with
at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred recent hosts
in my body,

whence my delirium here and there on the subject of
Christ, and the cross of Jesus Christ.

For nothing now appears to me more funereal or more

nothing more erotically pornographic than Christ, ig-
noble sexual materialization of all the false. psychic enig-

The Peyote Dance

*

THE PHYSICAL HOLD was still there. This cataclysm which
was my body . . . After twenty-eight days of waiting, I had
not yet come back into myself or, I should say, gone out
into myself. Into myself, into this dislocated assemblage,
this piece of damaged geology.

Inert, as earth with its rocks can be—and all those crev-
ices that run in sedimentary layers piled on top of each
other. Friable, of course, I was—not in places, but as a
whole—from my first moment of contact with this terrible
mountain which I am sure had raised barriers against me
to prevent me from entering. And since I’ve been up there,
the supernatural no longer seems to me something so ex-
traordinary that I cannot say that I was, in the literal sense
of the word, bewitched.

To take a step was for me no longer to take a step; but
to feel where I was carrying my head. Can you understand
this? Limbs which obey one after the other, and which one
moves forward one after the other; and the vertical posi-
tion above the earth which must be maintained. For the
head, overflowing with waves, the head which can no longer
control its whirling, the head feels all the whirling energies

of the earth below, which bewilder it and keep it from re-
maining erect.

Twenty-eight days of this heavy captivity, this ill-assem-
bled heap of organs which I was and which I had the im-
pression of witnessing like a vast landscape of ice on the
point of breaking up.

The hold was therefore upon me, so terrible that to go
from the house of the Indian to a tree located a few steps
away required more than courage, required summoning the
reserve forces of a truly desperate will. For to have come
this far, to find myself at last on the threshold of an en-
counter and of this place from which I expected so many
revelations, and to feel so lost, so abandoned, so deposed.
Had I ever known joy, had there ever in the world been a
sensation which was not one of anguish or of irremissible
despair; had I ever been in a state other than that intersti-
tial pain which every night pursued me? Was there any-
thing for me which was not at the gate of death, and could
at least one body be found, a single human body which
escaped my perpetual crucifixion?

It required, of course, an act of the will for me to believe
that something was going to happen. And all this, for what?
For a dance, for a rite of lost Indians who no longer even
know who they are or where they come from and who,
when you question them, answer with tales whose connec-
tion and secret they have lost.

After an exhaustion so cruel, I repeat, that I can no
longer believe that I was not in fact bewitched, or that
these barriers of disintegration and cataclysms I had felt
rising in me were not the result of an intelligent and or-
ganized premeditation, I had reached one of the last places

THE PEYOTE DANCE 47

in the world where the dance of healing by Peyote still
exists, or at least the place where it was invented. And what
was it then, what false presentiment, what illusory and
artificial intuition caused me to expect some sort of libera-
tion for my body and also and above all a force, an illumi-
nation throughout the reaches of my inner landscape,
which I felt at that precise minute to be beyond any kind
of dimensions?

Twenty-eight days since this inexplicable torment had
begun. And twelve days since I had come to this isolated
corner of the earth, this tiny compartment in the vast
mountain, waiting on the good will of my sorcerers.

Why was it that each time, as at this moment, I felt
myself touching on a vitally important phase of my exist-
ence, I did not come to it with a whole organism? Why
this terrible sensation of loss, of a void to be filled, of an
event that miscarries? To be sure, I would see the sor-
cerers carry out their rite; but in what way would this rite
profit me? I would see them. I would be rewarded for this
long patience which nothing until then had been able to
discourage. Nothing—neither the terrible road, nor the
voyage with a body which was intelligent but dissonant
and which had to be dragged, which had to be almost killed
to prevent it from revolting; nor nature with her sudden
storms which surround us with their nets of thunder; nor
that long night filled with spasms in which I had seen a
young Indian scratch himself in a dream with a kind of
hostile frenzy in exactly the places where these spasms
seized me—and he said, he who scarcely knew me from
the day before, “Ah, let him suffer all the evil that may be-
fall him.”

48 THE PEYOTE DANCE

Peyote, as I knew, was not made for Whites. It was nec-
essary at all costs to prevent me from obtaining a cure by
this rite which was created to act on the very nature of the
spirits. And a White, for these Red men, is one whom the
spirits have abandoned. If it was I who benefited from the
rite, it meant so much lost for themselves, with their in-
telligent sheathing of spirit.

So much lost for the spirits. So many spirits that could
not be utilized again.

And then there is the matter of the Tesguino, that alcohol
which requires eight days of fermentation in the jars—
and there aren’t that many jars or that many arms ready
to grind the corn.

Once the alcohol has been drunk, the sorcerers of Peyote
become useless and a whole new preparation becomes nec-
essary. But a man of these tribes had died when I arrived
at the village, and it was necessary that the rite, the priests,
the alcohol, the crosses, the mirrors, the rasping sticks, the
jars, and all that extraordinary paraphernalia of the Peyote
dance be requisitioned for the benefit of the man who had
died.

For now that he was dead his double could not wait for
these evil spirits to be neutralized.

And after twenty-eight days of waiting, I now had to
endure, throughout one long week, an incredible comedy.
All over the mountain there was a hysterical coming and
going of messengers who were presumably being sent to
the sorcerers. But after the messengers had left, the sor-
cerers would arrive in person, amazed that nothing was
ready. And I discovered that I had been tricked.

THE PEYOTE DANCE 49

They brought me priests who heal with dreams, and who
speak after they have dreamed.

“Those of Ciguri [the Peyote dance] not good,” they said.
“They do not work. Take these.” And they pushed toward
me some old men who suddenly broke in two, clicking
their amulets strangely under their robes. And I saw that
they were not sorcerers but magicians. And I also learned
that these false priests were intimate friends of death.

One day this commotion died down without protests,
without arguments, without fresh promises on my part. As
if all this had been part of the rite and as if the perform-
ance had lasted long enough.

I had not come to the heart of the mountain of these
Tarahumara Indians to look for memories of painting. I
had suffered enough, it seems to me, to be rewarded with a
little reality.

However, as the daylight faded, a vision confronted my
eyes.

I saw before me “The Nativity” of Hieronymus Bosch,
with everything in order and oriented in space, the old
porch with its collapsing boards in front of the stable, the
fire of the Infant King glowing to the left amid the ani-
mals, the scattered farms, and the shepherds; and in the
foreground other animals bleating, and to the right the
Dancer Kings. The kings, with their crowns of mirrors on
their heads and their rectangular purple cloaks on their
backs—at my right in the painting—like the Magi of Hie-
ronymus Bosch. And suddenly as I turned around, doubt-
ing to the last minute that I would ever see my sorcerers
arrive, I saw them coming down the mountain, leaning on



--- Page 27 ---

50 THE PEYOTE DANCE

huge staffs, their women carrying huge baskets, the serv-
ants armed with bundles of crosses like firewood, and
mirrors that glittered like segments of sky amid all this
apparatus of crosses, pikes, shovels, and tree trunks
stripped of their branches. And all these people were bent
under the weight of this extraordinary apparatus, and’ the
wives of the sorcerers, like their men, were also leaning
on huge staffs a head taller than they were.

Wood fires rose on all sides toward the sky. Below, the
dances had already begun; and at the sight of this beauty
at last realized, this beauty of glowing imaginations, like
voices in an illuminated dungeon, I felt that my effort had
not been in vain.

Above, on the slopes of the enormous mountain which
descended toward the village in tiers, a circle had been
drawn on the ground. The women were already kneeling
in front of their metates (stone basins), grinding the Pey-
ote with a kind of scrupulous violence. The priests began
to trample the circle. They trampled it carefully and in ail
directions; and in the middle of the circle they kindled a
fire that the wind from above sucked up in whorls.

During the day two young goats had been killed. And
now I saw, on a branchless tree trunk that had also been
carved in the shape of a cross, the lungs and hearts of the
animals trembling in the night wind.

Another tree trunk had been placed near the first, and
the fire that had been lighted in the middle of the circle
drew from it at every moment innumerable flashes of light,
something like a fire seen through a pile of thick glasses.
When I approached in order to discern the nature of this
burning center, I perceived an incredible network of tiny

THE PEYOTE DANCE 51

bells, some of silver, others of horn, attached to leather
straps which were also awaiting the moment for their
ritual use.

On the side where the sun rises they drove into the
ground ten crosses of unequal height but arranged in a
symmetrical pattern, and to each cross they attached a
mirror.

Twenty-eight days of this horrible waiting after the dan-
gerous withdrawal were now culminating in a circle peo-
pled with Beings, here represented by ten crosses.

Ten, of the Number of ten, like the Invisible Masters of
Peyote, in the Sierra.

And among these ten: the Male Principle of Nature,
which the Indians call San Ignacio, and its female, San
Nicolds!

Around this circle is a zone of moral abandonment in
which no Indian would venture: it is told that birds who
stray into this circle fall, and that pregnant women feel
their embryos rot inside them.

There is a history of the world in the circle of this
dance, compressed between two suns, the one that sets
and the one that rises. And it is when the sun sets that
the sorcerers enter the circle, and that the dancer with
the six hundred bells (three hundred of horn and three
hundred of silver) utters his coyote’s howl in the forest.

The dancer enters and leaves, and yet he does not leave
the circle. He moves forward deliberately into evil. He
immerses himself in it with a kind of terrible courage, in
a rhythm which above the Dance seems to depict the IIl-
ness. And one seems to see him alternately emerging and
disappearing in a movement which evokes one knows not



--- Page 28 ---

52 THE PEYOTE DANCE
what obscure tantalizations. He enters and leaves: “leaves
the daylight, in the first chapter,” as is said of Man’s
Double in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. For this advance
into the illness is a voyage, a descent in order to RE-
EMERGE INTO THE DAYLIGHT. He turns in a circle in
the direction of the wings of the Swastika, always from
right to left, and from the top.

He leaps with his army of bells, like an agglomeration
of dazed bees caked together in a crackling and tempestu-
ous disorder.

Ten crosses in the circle and ten mirrors. One beam
with three sorcerers on it. Four priests (two Males and two
Females). The epileptic dancer, and myself, for whom the
rite was being performed.

At the foot of each Sorcerer, one hole, at the bottom of
which the Male and Female principles in Nature, repre-
sented by the hermaphroditic roots of the Peyote plant
(Peyote, of course, has the shape of the male and female
sexual organs combined), lie dormant in Matter, that is,
in the Concrete.

And the hole, with a wooden or earthen basin inverted
over it, represents rather well the Globe of the World.
On the basin, the sorcerers rasp the mixture or the dis-
location of the two Principles, and they rasp them in the
Abstract, that is, in Principle. Whereas beneath, these two
Principles, incarnated, repose in Matter, that is, in the
Concrete.

And all night long the sorcerers reestablish the lost rela-
tionships with triangular gestures that Strangely cut off
the spatial perspective.

THE PEYOTE DANCE 53

Between the two suns, twelve tempos in twelve phases.
And the circular movement of everything that swarms
around the fire, within the sacred limits of the circle: the
dancer, the rasping sticks, the sorcerers.

After each phase, the sorcerers were eager to perform
the physical proof of the rite, to demonstrate the effective-
ness of the operation. Hieratic, ritual, sacerdotal, there
they stand, lined up on their beam, rocking their rasping
sticks like babies. From what idea of a lost formality do
they derive the sense of these bows, these nods, this circu-
lar movement in which they count their steps, cross them-
selves in front of the fire, salute one another, and leave?

So they get up, perform the bows I have mentioned,
some like men on crutches, others like sawed-off robots.
They step outside the circle. But once they have left the
circle, before they are a yard outside it, these priests who
walk between two suns have suddenly become men again,
that is, abject organisms who must be cleansed, whom this
rite is designed to cleanse. They behave like well-diggers,
these priests, some kind of night laborers created to piss
and to relieve themselves. They piss, fart, and relieve
themselves with terrible thunderous noises; and to hear
them one would think that they had set out to level the
real thunder, to reduce it to their need for abasement.

Of the three sorcerers who were there, two, the two
smallest and shortest, had had the right to handle the rasp-
ing stick for three years (for the right to handle the rasp
is acquired, and in fact this right determines the no-
bility of the caste of the Peyote sorcerers among the Tara-
humara Indians); and the third had had the right for ten



--- Page 29 ---

54 THE PEYOTE DANCE

years. And I must admit that it was the one most experi-
enced in the rite who pissed the best and who farted the
loudest and most expressively.

And a few moments later the same man, with the pride
of this manner of crude purgation, began to spit. He spat
after drinking the Peyote, as we all did. For after the
twelve phases of the dance had been performed, and since
dawn was about to break, we were passed the ground-up
Peyote, which was like a kind of muddy gruel; and in front
of each of us a new hole was dug to receive the spit from
our mouths, which contact with the Peyote nad hence-
forth made sacred.

“Spit,” the dancer told me, “but as deep in the ground
as possible, for no particle of Ciguri must ever emerge
again.”

And it was the sorcerer who had grown old in the har-
ness who spat most abundantly and with the largest and
most compact gobs. And the other sorcerers and the dancer,
gathered in a circle around the hole, had come to admire
him.

After I had spat, I fell to the ground, overcome with
drowsiness. The dancer in front of me passed back and
forth endlessly, turning and crying unnecessarily, because
he had discovered that his cry pleased me.

“Get up, man, get up,” he shouted each time he passed
me, with diminishing effect.

Aroused and staggering, I was led toward the crosses for
the final cure, in which the sorcerers shake the rasp on
the very head of the patient.

Thus I took part in the rite of water, the rite of the blows
on the skull, the rite of that kind of mutual cure which

THE PEYOTE DANCE 55

the participants give each other, the rite of immoderate
ablutions.

They uttered strange words over my head while sprin-
kling me with water; then they sprinkled each other
nervously, for the mixture of corn liquor and Peyote was
beginning to make them wild.

And it was with these final movements that the Peyote
dance ended.

The Peyote dance is contained in the rasping stick, in
this wood steeped in time which has absorbed the secret
salts of the earth. In this wand that is held out and with-
drawn lies the curative power of this rite, which is so re-
mote and which must be hunted down like a beast in the
forest.

There is an out-of-the-way spot in the high Mexican
Sierra where these rasping sticks seemingly abound. They
sleep there, waiting for the Predestined Man to discover
them and bring them into the light of day.

When a Tarahumara sorcerer dies, he takes leave of his
rasping stick with infinitely more sorrow than he feels in
leaving his body; and his descendants and intimates take
the rasp away and bury it in this sacred corner of the forest.

When a Tarahumara Indian believes that he is called
upon to handle the rasp and distribute the cure, he goes to
spend a week in the forest at Easter time every year for
three years.

It is there, they say, that the Invisible Master of Peyote
speaks to him with his nine advisers, and that he passes
the secret on to him. And he emerges with the rasping
stick properly macerated.

Carved out of the wood of a tree that grew in warm soil,



--- Page 30 ---

gray as iron ore, it carries notches on its length and signs
at its two extremities, four triangles with one point for the
Male Principle and two points for the Female of Nature,
made divine.

One notch for every year the sorcerer was alive after
he had acquired the right to handle the rasp and had be-
come a master capable of performing those acts of exor-
cism which pull the Elements apart.

And this is precisely the aspect of this mysterious tradi-
tion which I did not succeed in penetrating. For the Peyote
sorcerers seem truly to have gained something at the end
of their three years of retreats in the forest.

There is a mystery here which the Tarahumara sorcerers
have until now jealously guarded. Of what they have ac-
quired in addition, what they have recovered, if you will,
no Tarahumara Indian who is not a member of the aristoc-
racy of the sect seems to have the slightest idea. And as
for the sorcerers themselves, on this point they are reso-
lutely silent.

What is the singular word, the lost word which the
Master of Peyote communicates to them? And why does
it take the Tarahumara sorcerers three years to be able to
handle the rasp, with which, it must be admitted, they
perform some very curious auscultations?

What is it, then, which they have wrested from the for-
est, and which the forest yields to them so slowly?

In short, what has been communicated to them which
is not contained in the external apparatus of the rite, and
which neither the piercing cries of the dancer, nor his
dance, which goes back and forth like a kind of epileptic
pendulum, nor the circle, nor the fire in the middle of the

THE PEYOTE DANCE 57

circle, nor the crosses with their mirrors in which the dis-
torted heads of the sorcerers alternately swell and disap-
pear into the flames of the fire, nor the night wind that
speaks and blows on the mirrors, nor the chant of the sor-
cerers rocking their rasps, that astonishingly vulnerable
and intimate chant, can succeed in explaining?

They had laid me on the ground at the foot of that enor-
mous beam on which the three sorcerers were sitting dur-
ing the dances.

On the ground, so that the rite would fall on me, so that
the fire, the chants, the cries, the dance, and the night
itself, would turn over me like a living, human vault.
There was this rolling vault, this physical arrangement of
cries, tones, steps, chants. But above everything, beyond
everything, the recurring impression that behind all this,
greater than all this and beyond it, there was concealed
something else: the Principal.

I did not renounce as a group those dangerous dissoci-
ations which Peyote seems to provoke and which I had
pursued for twenty years by other means; I did not mount
my horse with a body pulled out of itself and which the
withdrawal to which I had abandoned myself deprived
henceforth of its essential reflexes; I was not that man of
stone whom it required two men to turn into a man on
horseback: and who was mounted on and dismounted from
the horse like a broken robot—and once I was on the horse,
they placed my hands on the reins, and they also had to
close my fingers around the reins, for left to myself it was
only too clear that I had lost the use of them; I had not
conquered by strength of mind that invincible organic
hostility in which it was I who no longer wanted to func-



--- Page 31 ---

tion, only to bring back a collection of outworn imageries
from which the Age, true to its own system, would at most
derive ideas for advertisements and models for clothing
designers. It was now necessary that what lay hidden be-
hind this heavy grinding which reduces dawn to darkness
—that this thing be pulled out, and that it serve, that it
serve precisely by my crucifixion.

To this I knew that my physical destiny was irrevocably
bound. I was ready for any burning, and I awaited the first
fruits of the fire in view of a conflagration that would soon
be universal.

The Land of the Magi Kings

*

WHERE HAD I HEARD that it was not in Italy but in Mexico
that the pre-Renaissance painters found the blue of their
landscapes, and the vast perspectives of the backgrounds
with which they embellished their Nativities?

In the land of the Tarahumara the most incredible leg-
ends offer proofs of their own reality. When one enters
this landscape and finds gods at the tops of mountains,
gods with an arm hacked off on the left side and an empty
space on the right side, and who lean to the right; and
when, bending down, one hears rising at one’s feet the
roar of a waterfall, and above the fall a wind that rushes
from peak to peak, and when one climbs until one can see
around one a vast circle of peaks, one can no longer doubt
that one has arrived at one of those sensitive points on
the earth where life has shown her first effects.

The pre-Renaissance painters of Italy were initiated into
a secret science which modern science has not yet com-
pletely rediscovered, and this science was also known to
the artists of the High Renaissance.

The blue of the remote backdrops of the high mountains
of Mexico evokes precise forms and ideas, it compels the
mind to revive the distant memory of a Science to which the

APPEARANCE OF THE THREE MAGI KINGS IS CONNECTED!]!!

It was not out of a religious spirit that the Piero della
Francescas, the Lucas van Leydens, the Fra Angelicos, the
Piero di Cosimos, or the Mantegnas painted so many Na-
tivities. It was because of a traditional preoccupation with
the Essential, a diligent pursuit of the secrets of life, and
because of that natural obsession of Great Minds with the
How and the Why of those first principles and first explo-
sions of Nature which were expressed in the Pagan legend
of Christmas.

If Religion later took over these principles and if the
masses were weak enough to turn away from the Principles
and to worship religion instead, so much the worse for the
foolish and fanatical masses; but this in no way weakens
the Principles. In the Tarahumara mountain everything
speaks only of the Essential, that is, of the principles ac-
cording to which Nature was created; and everything lives
only for these principles: the People, the storms, the wind,
the silence, the sun.

We are far from the warlike and civilized reality of the
modern world, and not warlike although civilized, but war-
like because civilized: this is how the Tarahumara think.
And their legends, or rather their Traditions (for here there
are no legends, no imaginary fables, but Traditions which
may be incredible, but whose reality is gradually being
proved by the excavations of scholars), their traditions
tell of the appearance among the Tarahumara tribes of a
race of fire-bearing Men who had three Masters or Kings
who traveled toward the Pole Star.

But if Science has its Masters—Newton, Darwin, Kep-
ler, Lavoisier, etc.—Civilizations also have their Masters,

from the moral and Social point of view—Odin, Rama,
Fu Hsi, Lao-tzu, Zoroaster, Confucius—and the legend of
the Three Magi Kings seems to conceal the journey through
the geographic line of the great Solar Tradition, wherever
Scientific Worship of the Sun has left its mathematically
oriented pyramids and altars, of three Civilizers who were
initiated into a transcendent astronomy whose laws were
comparable to those of Mayan astronomy.

When one knows that astronomical worship of the sun
has been universally expressed by signs, and that these
signs are identical to those of an ancient and very com-
plete science which the absurd language of Europe has
designated aS UNIVERSAL ESOTERISM; and that these
signs—the anserated cross, the Swastika, the Double cross,
the large circle with a dot in the middle, the two opposing
triangles, the three dots, the four triangles at the four
cardinal points, the twelve signs of the zodiac, etc.—are
found in profusion in the East as well as in Mexico, on
temples and in manuscripts (but never have I seen them
abound in Nature as they do in the heart of the Tara-
humara mountain); when one knows this and when one
suddenly finds oneself in a country that is literally haunted
by these signs, and when one recognizes them in the ges-
tures and rites of a race, and when the men, women, and
children of this race wear them embroidered on their cloth-
ing, one feels uneasy, as if one had arrived at the source
of a mystery.

But when one also considers that the Tarahumara Sierra
is the land where the first skeletons of gigantic men were
found, and that at the very moment I am writing, more
are constantly being found, many legends lose their leg-

endary appearance and become realities. A reality which
may have had its superhuman laws, although they were
based on nature, was rejected by the Renaissance of the
sixteenth century; and the Humanism of the Renaissance
was not an expansion but a diminution of man, since Man
stopped raising himself to the level of nature and brought
nature down to his own size, and an exclusive concern
with the human brought about the loss of the Natural.

It was then that the astronomical science of nature, ac-
cording to which life revolves around the Sun, became oc-
cult; but in this magical naturalism which is everywhere
the same and whose tradition is working its way steadily
from the east to the west, the Primitives of Florence, Assisi,
Como, etc., were initiated.

In their canvases of Nativities and of the Magi Kings,
these painters expressed a mystery of life, and they ex-
pressed it as the heirs of an age in which Art was primarily
the servant of a science; this is why their paintings, al-
though they may be read with the affective fibers of the
soul, may also be read with the high rational Science of
the mind. A color, if it enchants the heart, corresponds to
an exact and scientific vibration in which the Primal Num-
bers can be found.

And so it struck me as more than strange that the land
in which the tradition of the Magi as fire-bearers lives on
the face of the rocks, and in the clothing and the sacred
rites of the people, is also the land in which the colorful
rhythm and the awesome vibration of Nature recall with
the most haunting intensity a whole age of painting whose
Masters were obsessed with the same signs, the same
forms, the same lights, the same secrets.

The Rite of the Kings
of Atlantis

*

ON THE 16TH OF SEPTEMBER, the day on which Mexicans
celebrate their independence, I saw in Norogachic, in the
heart of the Tarahumara Sierra, the rite of the kings of
Atlantis as Plato describes it in the pages of Critias. Plato
talks about a strange rite which, because of circumstances
that threatened the future of their race, was performed
by the kings of Atlantis.

However mythical the existence of Atlantis may be,
Plato describes the Atlanteans as a race of magical origin.
The Tarahumara, whom I believe to be the direct descend-
ants of the Atlanteans, continue to devote themselves to
the observance of magical rites.

Let those who do not believe me go into the Tarahumara
Sierra: they will see that, in this land where the rocks
have the appearance and structure of a fable, legend be-
comes reality and that there can be no reality outside of
this fable. I know that the life of the Indians is not to the
taste of the modern world; however, in the presence of a
race like this one, we must conclude that it is modern life
which is backward in relation to something else, and not

64

THE RITE OF THE KINGS OF ATLANTIS 65

the Tarahumara Indians who are backward in relation
to the modern world.

They know that every step forward, every convenience
acquired through the mastery of a purely physical civiliza-
tion, also implies a loss, a regression.

As a consequence, one can say that in the presence of
any authentic tradition the question of progress does not
arise. Real traditions do not progress, since they represent
the most advanced stage of every truth. The only progress
that can be made consists in preserving the form and the
force of these traditions. Down through the centuries, the
Tarahumara have been able to learn how to preserve their
virility.

To return to Plato and the true esoteric traditions found
in his written works, I saw in the Tarahumara mountain
the rite of these visionary and desperate kings.

Plato relates that at sunset the kings of Atlantis gathered
in front of a bull that had been sacrificed. And while at-
tendants carved the bull into pieces, other attendants col-
lected the pieces and poured the blood into cups. The kings
drank this blood and became intoxicated as they sang a
kind of plaintive melody until there was nothing left in
the sky but the head of the dying sun and nothing left on
earth but the head of the sacrificed bull. Then the kings
covered their heads with ashes. And their plaintive melody
changed in tone as they tightened the circle they had
formed. Every invocation to the sun became a kind of
bitter reproach, took on the appearance of a public pen-
ance, a kind of remorse which the kings expressed with a
common accord until darkness had completely fallen.

This is the essence of the rite described by Plato. Well,

THE PEYOTE DANCE

shortly before the sun went down over Norogachic, the
Indians led an ox to the village square and, after tying its
feet, began to cut out its heart. The fresh blood was caught
in large jars. I shall not easily forget the ox’s grimace of
pain as the Indian’s knife ripped open its bowels. The
matachin dancers gathered in front of the bull and when
he was dead they began their flower dances.

For the Indians perform dances of flowers, dragonflies,
birds, and many other things in front of this butchery,
and it was truly a strange spectacle to see two Indians
mounted on the dead bull, collecting the blood and cutting
off chunks of flesh with axes, while other Indians dressed
like kings with crowns of mirrors on their heads performed
their dances of dragonflies, birds, wind, objects, flowers.

The dancing went on until the middle of the night.

A whole village may participate in the matachin dances,
but there is a king for each moment of the dance. And the
dancer kings take turns: each dances according to his
temperament.

That day there was only one musician, who sat on the
ground and played the violin. But the full orchestra con-
sisted of a guitar, a small drum, bells, and iron bars. The
small drum is a musical instrument of war; its sound re-
verberates from peak to peak.

The kings of the dance wear crowns of mirrors, the tri-
angular Masonic apron, and a large rectangular mantle
over their shoulders. They also have special trousers with
a triangular design at the bottom, which comes a little be-
low the knee.

The matachins are not a sacred rite but a popular and
profane dance which was brought to Mexico by the Span-

THE RITE OF THE KINGS OF ATLANTIS 67

ish; but the Tarahumara have given it an Indian form,
they have stamped it with their own spirit. Although origi-
nally these dances imitate the movements of external na-
ture—wind, trees, an anthill, a rushing river—among the
Tarahumara they take on a highly cosmogonic meaning,
and I felt as if I had before me and were contemplating
a mass of planetary ants swarming to the rhythm of a
celestial music.

They dance to the sound of a childlike and subtle music
that no European ear can perceive; at first, it seems as if
one is always hearing the same sound, set to the same
rhythm; but with time, these identical sounds and this
rhythm awaken in us something resembling the memory
of a great myth; they evoke the sense of a mysterious and
complicated history.

The leader of the dance contorted his body in time to
the rhythm, and his dance imitated the step of a tiny ant
tottering; the dancer bent double, contracted with the spas-
tic movements of an enormously swollen frog; his right
hand skillfully balanced a gourd full of rings made of hard-
ened caterpillars which had taken on the consistency of
glass, while his left hand played with a fan of flowers.

The music of the Tarahumara is divided into a very
limited number of tempos which are repeated indefinitely.
Each time the beat changes, the leader of the dance leaves
his place, abandons the spot where he was making his
contorted movements, and begins to circle around the
other dancers.

These dancers are divided into two groups, and each
dancer in turn presents his face to the leader. He does this
like a knight in armor, with the splendor of the ancient



--- Page 36 ---

warrior in full battle dress, then he turns and faces the
opposite direction. When the leader of the dance has cir-
cled around each dancer, he prances back to his place.
And one phase of the dance is over. But others take its
place and the frenzy resumes and continues all night, from
the instant the sun goes down until dawn, without the
dancers ever becoming tired.

A row of young people leaning sideways against the wall
—that is, not with their backs against the wall, but show-
ing sometimes the left side, sometimes the right—now and
then utter a frozen cry like a hunting horn in the forest,
and their voices evoke the mournful sound of a hyena, a
sick dog, or a strangled cock. This cry is not emitted con-
tinuously but at intervals; it passes from mouth to mouth
like a human scale which takes on in the darkness the
quality of a summons.

They danced this way until sunset, and while they
danced, other Indians picked up the pieces of the bull’s
body, leaving the head alone on the ground at the very
moment when the sun’s head sank in the sky. It was then
that the leaders of the dance stopped, and the dancers
formed a circle around them. And they all took up again a
kind of plaintive melody. A melody of remorse, of religious
penance, a secret summons to I know not what dark forces,
what presences from the beyond.

Next they went and sat down in front of a large fire at
some distance from the first place, in a spot that was cov-
ered and closed in like the night itself, for the second part
of the rite was to demonstrate its secrecy. It was at this
moment that they were given the living blood, served in

THE RITE OF THE KINGS OF ATLANTIS 69

cups. And the dance began again from the beginning and
went on all night.

The chunks of beef had been collected in four jars, and
over the jars the women formed a huge cross. Everyone
drank the warm blood and endlessly repeated the froglike
movements. At times everyone would be asleep. Then the
violin would offer its music and the dancing would begin
again. And the men, joining in now and then, would scream
like strangled jackals.

You may think what you will of the comparison I am
making. In any case, since Plato never went to Mexico
and since the Tarahumara Indians never saw him, it must
be acknowledged that the idea of this sacred rite came to
them from the same fabulous and prehistoric source. And
this is what I have tried to suggest here.

[Artaud’s published Spanish text was translated into French by Marie
Dézon and Philippe Sollers, from which this translation was made.

Supplement to a Voyage to the Land

of the Tarahumara

*

HuMaN consciousness has the right to ask itself many
questions, and I have asked myself many all over the world,
including even that ultimate interrogation in which con-
sciousness and question disappear and there is only the
indescribable flame that shoots out of the mind of God each
time His Heart is alerted.

For anyone who pursues the mental side of things with
his heart, there is a point, as in the Peyote rite of the Tara-
humara, when the fabric of perception opens in a cross, and
cracks in such a way that one no longer knows whether
it is from one’s own heart that this cross has emerged, or
from the heart of that Other, who then is no longer the
Other, any Other, but THAT oNE, the Only Source of
Flames, whose tongue pierces and gathers the taste for
the Word, when the heart which was beating like a Double,
recognizes its GENERATOR!

For if there is neither God nor problem, then neither is
there a heart to perceive nor a heart to tear the perception
that pierces, and to tear itself into a cross in the midst of
perception.

SUPPLEMENT TO A VOYAGE 71

Because I kept seeing around me men lying, lying about
the source of idea, idiotically refusing to advance as far as
ideas, I felt the need to leave mankind and to go away to a
place where I could at last freely advance with my heart,
all of this heart which before my attentive mind gathers
and sweeps away the emotions of images which come to it
from the circular Absolute, that woven tide which pierces
my spinal column and which my heart then flings back to-
ward my solar plexus with a spasm like the sea.

What constitutes the Self, I have no idea. Conscious-
ness? A horrible repulsion before the Nameless, the un-
woven, for the I comes when the heart has knotted it at
last, chosen, drawn out of this and that, against this and
for that, despite the eternal calculation of horrors with
which all the non-selves, demons, assail that which will
be my being, this being which I continue to see failing be-
fore my eyes as long as God has not passed his key to my
heart.

One sees God when one really wants to, and to see God
is to be dissatisfied with the little enclave of terrestrial
sensations which have never done anything but slightly
expand the hunger for a self and for a whole consciousness
which the world does not cease to murder and betray.

One day I was far from God, but at the same time never
had I felt so far from my own consciousness, and I saw
that without God there is neither consciousness nor being,
and that the man who believes himself to be still living
can never again reenter himself.

So it was that, growing toward God, I discovered the
Tarahumara. *

The highest idea of human consciousness and of its uni-

versal answers—Absolute, Eternity, Infinite—still exists in
this race of old Indians who say they have received the
Sun in order to transmit it to the deserving, and who in
the Rites of Ciguri have preserved the organic gate of that
ordeal by which our being, which the impure assembly of
beings has rejected, knows that it is connected with that
place beyond bodily perceptions where the Heart of the
Divine burns to summon us.

I do not know how many suns all the initiatory doctrines
of the earth, whose sole source I know and it is called
JESUS CHRIST, claim to have recognized, from the first to
the sixth sun, but it is clear that the Tarahumara of Mexico
have not yet fallen from the first, for they have preserved
within themselves the flaming image of that Source which
they call the Son of God. One day, say the priests of TUTU-
curt, the Great Celestial Healer appeared as if born out of
the open lips of the Sun, THE DESIRING, His Father in
Eternity. And He was Himself this sun, bearing in his hand
The First Cross, and He struck a blow; and other Solar
Crosses, and Doubles of Suns, were born out of Him, and
came out at each Syllable which this Mouth of Celestial
Crosses imprinted on the immensity in hosts of light.

Six times the Cross of light struck and the sun rebounded
in space. And the last sun was incorruptible and pure, as
one sees it still over the sea and the land, but even at the
first sun the darkness had reentered the light, for the Son
of the Desiring, having reascended to his Father, had re-
sumed with Him his journey through Eternity.

Now this is the true Story of Jesus Christ as it has been
handed down to us in the teachings of the original Chris-
tianity of the Catacombs, and I wanted to see whether,

SUPPLEMENT TO A VOYAGE 73

behind the sacred memory of those Rites which I know not
what paganism has overlaid, the Tarahumara of the mod-
ern age would recognize their Initiator.

And an impression of the true face of Christ was shown
them, the same one that was imprinted on the veil of St.
Veronica in the march toward Golgotha; and after myste-
riously conferring, the priests of TUTUGURI came and told
me that this was indeed his face, and that it was in this
form that the Son of God had once appeared to the an-
cestors of their fathers.

And this Healer of the Infinite had given them a plant
on his Travels, in order to reopen for the tempted and tired
soul the gates of Eternity. And this plant is c1GuRr.

For the soul goes from day to night, like the earth; only
the sun goes from light to light; for him there is only the
day, and night is that which is always far from him. But
who shail say at night that there is no sun? Who shall say,
when the heavens are dense with clouds, that no sun has
ever overcome them? Today this is all that people say
about someone whom I have seen as truly as I see the sun;

~ and I do not doubt it on rainy days! This Someone, all

those whom I love on this earth have desired him with
me, and missed him; and they and I have revolved an im-
measurable time as if in the lost trail of a star, until this
star has exploded before the human eye, and until we have
finally seen it explode. And whoever among my friends
and my brothers has seen this sun explode, someday he
too will remember it and say it, and what a beautiful day
that will be. As for the others, they will have become too
much like animals in order to obscure the Truth.

74 THE PEYOTE DANCE

—It often happens that night rises darkly over the soul
and in such a way that the soul, driven by temptation and
weary, no longer remembers clearly whence it came: from
above or from below, from the light or from the shadows.
It is at such times that the Peyote given by Jesus Christ
intervenes. It snatches the soul from behind and sets it
again in the eternal light, as it proceeds from the Spirit on
high; and maintaining it in this On-High it teaches the
soul to distinguish between itself and that unfathomable
energy which is as the infinite multiple of its own capaci-
ties and which begins where we, those millions upon mil-
lions called beings, burn out and run dry.

—No matter how high I have risen in the shadows of
the mind, I am not always conscious of having decided for
the clearest reasons in favor of this or that. There is be-
tween the self and the non-self a conflict which the ages
have not yet resolved. The Illusory, which I do not like,
often gives me the impression that it occupies my con-
sciousness with a seductive vigor much stronger than the
Real. This is because before me there is temptation: the
temptation to be this or that, like this or like that, this one
or that one. This is the reason for that terrible battle which
in the foreconscious of my Will and of my Acts I have
always waged with that which was not me. But who is to
tell me by virtue of what I have decided to choose my
consciousness. Man experiences Good and Evil as if a force
dictated them to him, but he has never seen himself at
the Source that distributes those nameless impulses that
cause him to judge and to prefer. When he does Good he
judges it to be better, reassuring, and very preferable, but
when he does Evil, or when for an instant he considers

SUPPLEMENT TO A VOYAGE 75

it, he wonders if it is not by chance Evil which might be
the better, and for what reasons, the very reasons that dis-
appeared from his mind which Evil has just plunged in
darkness, the Good was conceived by him as Good and
Evil as bad, whereas God, only a little further away than
he claims to believe that he lives, has never ceased to tell
him so. But God is that which he has never wanted to
hear.

—In accepting himself in this way without curiosity
about God and without problems, man is now nothing
but an inert automaton, generating boredom and madness,
which all consciousness has abandoned, and which the
still pure soul has fled, because it senses in advance the
moment when this Automaton will give birth to the Beast,
and the Beast to an obscene demon.

I felt, therefore, that I should go back to the source and
expand my pre-consciousness to the point where I would
see myself evolve and desire. And Peyote led me to this
point. Transported by Peyote I saw that I had to defend
what I am before I was born, and that my Self is merely
the consequence of the battle I waged in the Supreme

‘against the untruth of evil ideas.

And human beings can drone on and on that things are
as they are and that there is nothing else to look for; for
myself, I see clearly that they have lost their footing, and
that they don’t know what they are saying, and have not
for a long time, for they have forgotten the source of those
mental states with which they hold themselves above the
flow of ideas, and which are the basis of language.

Indeed, it has been centuries since their thinkers, like
the rest, abdicated the honorable effort that is involved in



--- Page 40 ---

76 THE PEYOTE DANCE

earning one’s consciousness, once one knows where it must
be won.

—The Unconscious does not belong to me except in
dreams, and then, everything that I see in it and that
lingers—is it a form selected to be born, or something un-
clean that I have rejected?

The Subconscious is that which is exhaled by the first
premises of my inner Will, but I am not sure who reigns
there, and I believe that it is not me, but that mass of op-
posing Wills which, I don’t know why, thinks inside me,
and has never had any other preoccupation or any other
idea in the world than to take my own place in my body
and in my self.

But in the Pre-conscious in which their Temptations
abuse me, I see all these evil wills again, but armed this
time with all my consciousness, and what does it matter
if they unfurl it against me, since now I feel that I am
there?

In the Pre-conscious, Peyote will hold me, and above the
state of man I shall know from what source my Will was
formed, and by what force it fell back in the direction in

which the Good calls, against the Evil which was pursuing ~

it.

Good and Evil, say the priests of Ciguri—as later the
Mystics of Jesus Christ restated it, no longer in terms of
sensations and visions, but with the evidence of martyrdom
and the experience of their wounds—Good and Evil are
not two opposing fabrics or principles; Good is that which
exists and Evil that which does not exist, which will not
live, and which will cease. The Self of man will not believe
in it always. But this science he has yet to attain.

SUPPLEMENT TO A VOYAGE 77

And it would appear that the purpose of the Peyote
Dance, originally a Rite designed to reveal the teachings
of the Plant given to man by Jesus Christ, was to invite
the human creature to arrive at consciousness. For with-
out help he cannot make up his mind to it.

It has taken thousands of years of trials for the soul to
recognize what it accepted or rejected in this unleashing
of powerful appetites in which consciousness is constantly
atoning and-being born above any figure of Purity or of
Sin.

I live and I was born with the limitless temptation of
being: what shall I be, where did I come from, where am
I going and how? And I do not know whether at my death
I shall have stopped choosing, struggling, rejecting. But
why must all my impulses toward the beyond, toward
openness, always be mingled with these calculations of
the unspeakable, these insinuations of a base eroticism?

Shall I, then, never again see things in the light of
chastity in which they were born? Why is my pure tempta-
tion to be and to live joined with this foul aspiration to
exist only by and in Sin?

Man today is unclean and impure. He cannot distin-
guish between the base and the Sublime, between eroticism
and Poetry.

One day I decided to throw off this abominable enslave-
ment which I knew very well did not come from me, but
had been imposed on me by that infernal coalition of
creatures who have taken over and polluted our conscious-
ness just as they are disordering Reality.

And I saw, on the mountains of Mexico, above all hu-
man trials, the glowing flames of a Great Bleeding Heart.



--- Page 41 ---

78 THE PEYOTE DANCE

Caught, as I rose, as if by the arm of the sea, I saw myself
flung back outside of the uncertain conformity of things,
and laid out as I am at last, myself, in the Truth of the
Essential.

Behind Ciguri there is completion, plethora, the ple-
thora of fulfillment.

But at the bottom of Ciguri, and in this Flaming Heart
a Form in which I could not help recognizing JEsUS
curisT: the perception of the complete Unalterable, the
entire Cross, incorruptibly spreads, at the Cardinal Points
of all Satiety.

With JEsUs CHRIST-PEYOTE, I heard the human body,
Spleen, Liver, Lungs, Brain, thundering at the four corners
of the Divine Infinite. And what extraordinary necessity
dictated their organic arrangement.

But internally replaced in the stature of my limbs, I saw
the Cross of Calvary appear like a bloody rending of or-
gans, which has enabled the human mind to grasp, by the
virtues of this very blood, its own, the shoals of Eternity.

And this cross explained to me human consciousness.
And with the help of Ciguri of the cross I saw the original
prototypes of every state and every form swell to that point
of terrible explosion where the soul of man is cut into
four parts at the very moment it realizes that it is going to
fall into this opacity which has the face of Sin. For to
hold oneself in consciousness is to hold oneself above Sin.
And nothing has the right to be called consciousness except
that which has been able never to leave the shoal of Eter-
nity. Outside of this the human being will founder, how-
ever strongly he believes that he is still alive, when the
Seers see him already delivered.

SUPPLEMENT TO A VOYAGE 79

With Ciguri-Jesus Christ I saw, steeped in high thun-
derclouds, all that is consciousness and being, and below,
in the non-existent, that image in which the debased con-
sciousness of man believed it molded sexuality. For it is
sexuality which is sin. And to touch it is to run away
from being and sink into the void.

It was thus that my experience with Peyote saved me
from the void and that, once I had gone beyond the cross
of the spasm in which my heart by bursting was made
new, I went behind things at the place where the Virgin of
the Eternal struck me, then sent me back, and I reemerged
on earth as if struck by lightning in my mind.

Thad in no sense touched God, of course, for it is not by
means of a physiological experiment that one arrives at
Divinity; but I had understood one of the essential Laws by
which his Force in transmitting itself has ordered the
tenor of Existence, and that is the law of Purity.

Be chaste or perish, this is what I learned while I was
with the Tarahumara of the mountain, but which Evil had
caused even them to forget.

And this Law is not peculiar to me, but it was made for

~ all men from the beginning of time and for all time. And

I know that we shall see it again and that now it will not
go away. And that man before he leaves the earth will
sweat his blood because of this Law.

As for God, All the Rigorous Eminence which nothing
in the world can take away, it is not in the Unreal but in
the Real that one finds him, however far beyond ordinary
consciousness his Reality may be. But the Supreme Divine
Reality is at the bottom of the heart of every man for
whom Love is loving. Loving from the heart; giving with-

out taking. Something which the senses cannot do. And
which the world of earthly life has refused to realize.

Those who say that there is no God do so because they
have forgotten the heart.

The infinite emulsion of the heart is what Evil has tried
to kill in the worlds, but in this emulsion there are many
folds, thicknesses, substances, and textures, and each thick-
ness is an idea, and the idea a state of the heart, and a
creature with its own soul, and each state of the sensible
a substance that has come out of God, and the Source of
all Substance this Giving Heart, Distributor of substances
of being who gives its substance to Being in the Multi-
formity of the Infinite. And where would he die, He who
could not be killed? For besides being the Idea of the Eter-
nally Renascent, God is also Someone; and this someone is
the inexhaustible Active who, over all sleep and all dreams,

swallows that which, in the further of Him-Self, later, He
will give! Later. In that later in which there burst forth the
Word, his Son, in Flames of Love that will never fail.

And it was this God of Eternal Charity whom the fol-
lowing year I went to find among the Irish.

THE Priests of Ciguri have a strange doctrine which
strangely resembles that doctrine of Grace which two hun-
dred years ago provoked the bitterest struggles. But it pro-
voked much worse struggles, this time not in intellectual
debates or in words but in events, in the pericd following
the death of Jesus Christ. But these struggles have been
forgotten. And yet...

The priests of Ciguri say that Peyote is not given to
everyone and that to have access to it one must be Pre-
destined. For Ciguri is a God jealous of his science and
he does not allow this science to be forgotten. But the states
through which Peyote forces one to go constitute a dis-
orientation of terrible rigor. Anyone who, after emerging
from these states, has lost some part of them, can no
longer be entitled to the Word, because without meaning
to he will lie about the Essential. And the Essential is the
gatekeeper of God.

But Ciguri defends itself, and anyone who has not en-
tered into it with a relatively pure conscience will surrender
all the essential parts of his conscience to the Infinite,
since he is unworthy to keep them. As for the unworthy,
he will remain at the door. And to enter into Peyote with a
bad conscience is to expose oneself to a terrible correction.

A Note on Peyote

*

I rook PEYoreE in the mountains of Mexico, and I had a
dose of it that lasted me two or three days with the Tarahu-
mara, and at the time those three days seemed like the
happiest days of my life.

Thad stopped tormenting myself, trying to find a reason
for my life, and I had stopped having to carry my body
around.

Trealized that I was inventing life, that that was my func-
tion and my raison détre, and that I suffered when my
imagination failed, and Peyote gave it to me.

A human being stepped forward and drew the Peyote
out of me with a blow.

I made it into real shreds, and the cadaver of a man was
torn to shreds and found torn to shreds, somewhere.

Letters concerning the Tarahumara

*

To Jean Paulhan
Paris, February 4, 1937
Dear friend,

Having arrived at the heart of the Tarahumara moun-
tain, I was struck by physical reminiscences so compelling
that they seemed to evoke direct personal memories. Every-
thing—the life of the ground and of the grass below, the
jagged profile of the mountain, the particular shapes of
the rocks, and above all, the haziness of those layers of
light in the unending perspective of peaks ranged one
above the other, farther and farther back, in an unimagin-
able distance—everything seemed to represent an experi-
ence I had had before, an experience that had already
passed through me, rather than the discovery of a world
that was strange but new, All this was not new. The sense
of déja vu is vague, I mean undated; my impression was
precisely situated; for this organic experience that I had had
before recalled another to which I felt connected, perhaps
indirectly, but all the same by tangible bonds. These were
reminiscences of history that came to me from each rock,
each plant, each horizon. I did not invent the apparition
of the Magi Kings: it was painstakingly imposed on me

84

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 85

by a landscape constructed like the landscapes in painting,
which certainly do not come from nothing. I do not be-
lieve in an absolute imagination, I mean one that makes
something out of nothing, for me there is no mental image
that is not the detached member of an image that has been
lived and experienced somewhere. And so these vast, un-
inhabited images evoked in me others which were once
populated, and their life seemed to me to unfold on an
extraordinary level; it was not I who invented the tradi-
tion of magical signs, and that this mountain was haunted
by them is a fact; I made a preliminary attempt at their
nomenclature in one of the articles I sent you, but stone
by stone, in the final analysis, and at the end of the trip,
Thad the impression that I had recorded them all: starting
with the / which is cut into //, broken in the middle
by a bar rt with opposite it the same straight line that came
out of it @p sand I can't help it if this H shape which
seems to result is the central form around which Plato
tells us that the Atlanteans had built their towns. You may
find it childish, but it exists in the Tarahumara mountain
and in Plato; I saw a rock striped with three vertical bars,
3, and on top of it a smaller one striped with a single bar;
I saw the enormous phallic tooth I already told you about
with 3 stones on the top and 4 holes on the side; I saw,
in a cleft in a rock, the circular head of a man where at
dawn the solar disk fits exactly, and below, the man’s body
lengthened in shadows with the right arm extended like a
bar of light, and the left like the same bar, but made of
shadows too, and bent; I saw the figure of death as if up-
rooted from the surrounding rocks, and in its enormous
left hand it held an infant; and I am not mentioning all



--- Page 45 ---

86 THE PEYOTE DANCE

the images and all the resemblances I saw, which revealed
a forgotten fauna of nature; which seemed to recall cen-
turies-old myths in which man, having been tamed, con-
verses with the Kingdoms that have subdued him; and if
the universal world of the Jews is represented by two over-
lapping triangles, the world of all the Races of red origin
is symbolized by two triangles connected by the ideal line
of a tree; this world I saw a hundred times on the rocks,
born of I know not what astonishing accident of nature;
on the trees: imprinted by the hand of man himself; and
wherever I encountered this famous “/, which is, in fact,
the H of generation, I saw emerging and as if drawn out
of trees that had been burned from top to bottom to bring
out their shape, I saw the shape of a man and woman
facing each other, and the man’s penis was erect; how
many times did I encounter the little world of the earth
represented by a circle and around this circle the much
vaster one of the indeterminate Universe; how many times
did I come upon the cross of the Rosicrucian tradition: 4
triangles pointing toward the 4 cardinal points and all
centered around a point; I saw this sign! Can I help it if
it corresponds to the cross of the Rosicrucian tradition, if
this is the way it is revealed to us that the Rosicrucians
formed their crosses? And this symbol was repeated a
thousand times, not only in uninhabited Nature, but on
the doors of houses made of a single piece of wood; but on
walls, in the shadows of roofs; I saw houses whose fagades
were related to one another by means of squares and dots,
and sometimes by means of rectangles stacked one on top
of the other in piles which seemed to grow taller; and was
I not told in the mountain that these scattered geometrical

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 87

figures were not scattered but united, and that they con-
stituted the Signs of a language based on the very shape of
breath when it is released in sound? The universal magic
is not founded on many more elementary signs than
those which I encountered in the raw and in nature in a
mountain which even aside from these signs has the light
of a haunted land. It required much less for novelists and
poets to discover and describe myths which their imagina-
tion alone invented; in recounting my voyage I have not
pretended to write a scholarly thesis, to trace the path of
a solid tradition, or to furnish proofs to corroborate it; if
people draw their own conclusions from these encounters,
it doesn’t matter; and it doesn’t really matter to me whether
the Magi Kings on their way home made a side trip through
the uninhabited mountains of Mexico; but I know that
once I got up there, overlooking almost infinite miles of
landscape, I felt stirring strongly within me strange remi-
niscences and images which at the time I started out I
could never have foreseen. And seeing in these mountains
encrusted with more shapes than the walls of certain
temples in India have divinities, seeing men go by in head-
bands, men wrapped in mantles which also had embroi-
dered on them triangles, crosses, dots, circles, teardrops,
and streaks of lightning; and these crosses, these dots,
these circles, these rectangles, these teardrops and these
zigzag stripes were by no means distributed at random
like decorative shapes in a symmetry which would have
robbed them of all their meaning, but never did I see 2
mantles bearing the same signs, and each was the color of
the uneducated face of the man who wore it; seeing these
men go by apparently ignorant of the symbolism in which



--- Page 46 ---

their lives seemed steeped, I could not believe that all this
represented any kind of effort or study on their part, or
was the result of a conscious and open-eyed premeditation;
they did these things, they said, because their fathers did
them, and from father to father I wondered to what source
these practices could be traced; the most unquestioning
brain would have asked itself where these vestiges could
have come from and what more than human tradition
their presence signified.

Green and yellow are, are they not, the opposing colors
of death: green for resurrection, yellow for decomposition,
decay, and if coincidences mean anything you will in
conclusion allow me to draw your attention to the phe-
nomenon which I am going to relate.

I arrived at nightfall in one of those villages dominated
by phalluses, those phalluses stamped with figures which
seem to have been put there by a natural accident; some-
one, I don’t know who, was whistling the melody of a
Tarahumara dance, 5 high-pitched measures which sud-
denly fall down a hundred stories, and then a voice replies
as if out of the depths; a child walked toward us, all alone,
naked under a gray mantle, his face literally devoured by
pus: a kind of greenish filament in the bone of the fore-
head seemed to replace the path of a vein; he ate greedily
the food that was offered to him, although remaining at a
respectful distance; I thought I noticed on the front of his
mantle a red triangle with the point at the top, and when
he turned around I saw on his back a teardrop, an enor-
mous embroidered teardrop which was as tall as he was;
the point was at the top and it swelled out to the left:

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 89

and I immediately shrugged my shoulders at the image it
evoked in me; in fact, I made an effort to curb my always
hasty imagination; and yet I cannot deny the image that
presented itself to me at that moment; and I am going to
repeat this image at the risk of making you shrug your
shoulders as I did myself: I thought of the FIAT LUX of
God, and of the form which Robert Fludd, in his Théatre
de l’Eternelle Sapience, uses to represent the original im-
pulse of the creation; this tear, this curved vessel-—this
is how he represents the light which having emerged from
the void curves around gradually and surrounds the shad-
ows which it is to replace; the tear alone might have
been nothing, but the red tear with the red triangle was
in itself a rather striking parallel; several weeks went by,
I penetrated the heart of the mountains, I saw the scat-
tered priests of Peyote who grind all night on their rasps the
mixture of first principles; and I started on my way back.

I passed again through the village with the phallus and
on the stroke of noon asked for shelter at a wretched house
from which there emerged an Indian who in spite of the
torrid midday heat was enveloped in a huge mantle. I had
already seen some strange mantles in my travels over the
mountain: but this one had four extremely narrow white
triangles which occupied the entire length of the garment;
the borders were decorated with a line of crosses which



--- Page 47 ---

90 THE PEYOTE DANCE

were green on one side and yellow on the other and were
composed of the 4 triangles I have already mentioned; the
Indian greeted us without a word, with a slow but intelli-
gent smile; and already the woman was going to work.
While she was preparing the corn and the greens I noticed
a false braid that she wore attached to her hair; through
this braid had been worked a length of yarn alternately
green and yellow, the same colors as the crosses; and she
also wore a necklace of green beads, and at her ears hung
yellow stones; inside the house, children were fighting with
shrill cries, and out came a very small boy with an enor-
mous stomach, his mouth surrounded with boils, and be-
hind him an older boy whom I recognized as the child in
the gray mantle embroidered with a triangle and a tear-
drop; I saw nothing unusual inside the house except in
one corner a cross whose top was a spearhead and whose
arms were in the shape of trefoils. The Indian, when ques-
tioned, maintained a perfect silence.

There, dear friend, I wanted to tell you what I saw with-
out drawing any sort of conclusion from it, you will see
that the facts and the objects speak for themselves, and
more convincingly no doubt than I have made them speak,
although no doubt in the same sense. Perhaps someday
I shall amuse myself by reporting, or I shall report with-
out amusement, the world which all these things made me
dream that I was entering, a world that I feel many mod-
ern things would gain a great deal by entering. It is not
from the point of view of the picturesque that I wish to
report this voyage but from the point of view of healing
power.

I would have preferred you to tell me that it is the occult
thesis itself that you do not like; and yet in all the ob-
scurity that surrounds modern poetry and language there
are far fewer ideas than in all this.

I am very much taken with this idea of the 3 Magi Kings
which one finds at the source of several essential histories,
and of a whole tradition. My essay is not overloaded; it is
terribly concentrated and elliptical for the enormous sub-
ject which I have chosen to raise. But I am not done with
this subject: I plan to bring it up again, in a different way,
elsewhere; for the moment let’s stick to this plan which
you have proposed.

Very affectionately,

Dance: it was impossible for me to finish it. And it is not
until Now that I begin to see what I wanted to say, which
is so remote from what I was writing before I came here;
——— which is myself, in short, whereas the rest was
only the caricature of myself, except for sudden flashes!!!
Wasn’t that letter full of things that I wrote you, at least
fragments of it, one of these sudden flashes, and couldn't
we append part of it to the Voyage? Especially the passage
where I talk about the pustulous child. It seems to me we
could.———.

Dear friend,

Here is one of the first things I have written since I left
the Maison de Santé.

For a long time I have been wanting to do an article re-
stating the question of astrology for our time. A com-
munication which I mention in the article provided me
with the occasion (For Pair du mois?) because it is of cur-
rent interest.

I hope very much that you will be able to publish it in
April.

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 93

You will see that it is a serious, documented article, and
also one in which I think I have once again found my
personal tone. I am also sending you the first part of the
Peyote Dance under separate cover.

Affectionately,

ANTONIN ARTAUD

To Jean Paulhan
[Paris] March 28, 1937
Dear friend,

Here, aT LAST, is the final part of the Peyote Dance.

There is also a general conclusion, but I think that for
the selection of Excerpts that is to appear in the Revue,
this is enough. Since these are Excerpts from A Voyage to
the Land of the Tarahumara.

Besides, the conclusion would excessively lengthen my
text, which is already twice as long as The Land of the Magi
Kings, which I have eliminated.

You now have all the pieces and you can make a deci-
sion. -

All of the Peyote Dance has been rewritten in the spirit
and feeling in which I revised, or rather in which I recast
The Mountain of Signs, which you liked so much. I very
much hope that this Dance as you now have it will please
you as much. In any case, write me about it as soon as
possible to set my mind at ease. But this time tell me
directly what you think of it.

From my own point of view I have said in this Dance



--- Page 49 ---

94 THE PEYOTE DANCE

exactly what I saw, and I have said it point by point. My
personal impressions I have also described point by point.
So there is no longer any arbitrary or preconceived thesis,
no longer anything unfounded, but a mysterious thing in
which what is visible is only the allusive outer garment,
if you will, of something else infinitely more important,
something absolutely important in itself. It seemed to me
that this something was serious, was essential. And this
will appear in my complete book on the voyage, about
which I have no doubt, my dear Jean Paulhan, and I say
this in all faith, in all conviction and sincerity, that it was
guided by the Invisible, as I feel that my whole life is now
guided. This is why I regard these Excerpts as an impor-
tant Introduction to an event that will take place before
long, as soon as I have fully recovered my forces on the
deepest level, and why I am so anxious that it appear
without too great a delay, before the end of Spring, in
order to really be what it is, the groundwork for something
else.

Forgive this enigmatic language.

You can’t know how true it is and how grateful I am to
you for serving by your two interventions* that which will
come out of all this.

Affectionately,

ANTONIN ARTAUD

behalf: by supporting a request for assistance to the Writers’ Fund

Artaud’s disintoxication treatment at the clinic on the rue Boileau.

Sceaux,

Dear friend,

No news of you. I must confess that I am impatient to
see the Voyage published at last. Didn’t you receive my last
long letter in which I give you all the details on the spirit in
which The Dance of Healing by Peyote was written? I hope
very much that you are completely satisfied with this text
and that people will understand what I have tried to put
into it—which is for me of absolute importance.

I received the proofs of The Theater and Its Double. I
am very anxious that the preface be printed in italics.
Anyway, I'm rewriting it. Couldn’t you also find the other
versions of certain texts which I had sent you by letter
and which do not appear in the proofs that have been sent
to me?

Until I see you, I am,

Dear Sir,

I have written Voyage to Mexico of which the Voyage
to the Land of the Tarahumara is the most important part.
But the text of the Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara
is complete in itself. As for the Voyage to Mexico, it is a book
of 200 pages or more which I worked on for eight months,



--- Page 50 ---

96 THE PEYOTE DANCE

from November 1936, the date of my return from Mexico,
to August 1937, the date of my departure for Ireland, and
which is not completely finished.

Merely in the time between September 1937 and today
I have been arrested, put in prison in Dublin, deported
to France, interned in Le Havre, transferred from Le
Havre to Rouen, from Rouen to Sainte-Anne in Paris, from
Sainte-Anne to Ville-Evrard, from Ville-Evrard to Chezal-
Benoit and from Chezal-Benoit to Rodez. All my personal
belongings have been confiscated by the police and all my
papers have been lost. I have absolutely nothing left of
what I possessed before, which consisted of a number of
manuscripts, a billfold, and above all a little sword from
Toledo 12 centimeters high with 3 fishhooks attached
which was given to me by a Negro from Cuba. The director
of the Prison of Dublin, Mr. de Soto, personally returned
all my belongings to me. Even in Le Havre, where I was
particularly badly treated, this sword was returned to
me in the red leather case in which it was contained. At
Sainte-Anne I still had my billfold, a brown alligator
leather billfold with my initials, and the little red leather
case containing the sacred sword, an object known to all
Initiates, but since Ville-Evrard I no longer know what has
become of these things. As for my personal papers and
manuscripts, I have lost track of them since my return to
France. And to rewrite this Voyage to Mexico and finish
it would now take me almost a year. Besides, the atmos-
phere of confinement does not lend itself to this kind of
work. In order to write, one must be free. Nevertheless, I
am going to try to add a few pages to A Voyage to the Land
of the Tarahumara. Dr. Ferdiére, who is urging me strongly

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 97

to do so, will see that I have all the facilities I need. In my
six years of confinement he is the only doctor who has tried
to mitigate my captivity within the limits of his means.

There is one thing of which I am certain, that it was at
Chezal-Benoit that the little red leather case containing
the sword from Toledo was not returned to me.

As for my manuscripts, it was when I was released from
prison in Dublin that I saw them for the last time. After
that I lost track of them.

Besides, we are all going through a period of trials and
misfortunes and I cannot work when for the past three
years I haven't had enough bread.

But, I repeat, I am going to make an effort to overcome
all these obstacles and I will pray to Jesus Christ especially
on this subject, for it is He who is behind my whole Voyage
to Mexico and it is He, the Word of God, whom the Tara-
humara worship, as I was able to observe in the Rite of
Tutuguri which takes place exactly at the rising of the Sun.

And they themselves recognized this and told me so
when two impressions of the Face of Christ were shown
them. One on the Veil of Saint Veronica, the other on an
Image taken at another moment of His Passion, and in
which His True Face is perfectly recognizable. The sacer-
dotal class of the Indian Priests of the Sun regard them-
selves as a terrestrial emanation of his Virtue and his
Force and each priest as the identification of one of his
Rays. And one must see the wild energy with which each
priest hurls himself to the ground at the precise moment
when the solar hearth, which itself has never ceased to be
free, is released in Indian consciousness from the im-
prisonment of the shadows of the night. One must see how



--- Page 51 ---

98 THE PEYOTE DANCE

each priest, by the position he knows how to take, repro-
duces with the other priests his brothers the extraordinary
division of this hearth. But above all one must hear the
Words which they send back and forth from one to the
other with signs which seem drawn from the very edge of
Eternity and which are made to sustain and manifest
something, and this something is The Spirit of the Word
which rolls like a ball of flame before the mouth of Lord
God, and of which they, the Tara-Humara* remember,
they say, having been and being the Will and the reflec-
tion.

But here they all began to weep, for as they told me:
“This Will of God of which we were all the Angels, that is,
the Rays, you see that very few of us still are, because too
much Evil has passed over us. The war between Evil and
God is not yet over and if the Kingdom of God is to come
to earth we must be chaste. We are as chaste as possible.
But people all over the earth are no longer chaste at all.
And the time has come for them to return to complete
chastity. For things were made by the sun and like him,
and they were made like this,” these priests told me, mak-
ing certain signs with their arms and bodies which con-
stitute the most extraordinary attitudes of Religious Dance
I have ever seen.

Among these signs was the Sign of the Cross as the

* Written like this in the original letter. Artaud has broken Tara-
humara into two elements: Tara suggests the famous historical, al-
most mythical site of Tara, in Ireland, with which Artaud was not un-
familiar; and Humaras the future of the verb humer, to inhale. One
must also bear in mind the Sanskrit word tara meaning star, or the
pupil of the eye.—Gallimard ed.

LETTERS CONCERNING THE TARAHUMARA 99

Catholics make it, but there was an infinity of other
signs.
It is all this which I have already talked about in my
manuscripts and which I am going to try to rewrite now.

Tutuguri: The Rite
of Black Night

*

DEDICATED to the external glory of the sun Tutuguri is a
black rite.

The Rite of black night and of the eternal death of the sun.

No, the sun will never come back

and the six crosses of the circle that the star must travel
are really there only to bar its path.

For no one understands well enough, no one understands
at all here in Europe that the cross is a black sign,

no one understands well enough “the salivary power of the
cross,”

and that the cross is a stream of saliva spat on the words
of thought.

In Mexico the cross and the sun are equals, and the leap-
ing sun is this whirling phrase which takes six beats to
reach the light of day,

the cross is a contemptible sign which must be burned by
matter,

why contemptible, ;

because the tongue which salivates its sign is contemptible,

100

TUTUGURI: THE RITE OF BLACK NIGHT ror

and why does it salivate its sign?

To anoint it.

For no sign is holy or sacred unless it is anointed.

But at the moment the tongue anoints it does it not form
a point?

does it not place itself between the four cardinal points?

So when the sun appears it must leap over the six points of
the contemptible phrase to be saved, of which it will
make a kind of translation on the level of lightning.

For the sun really appears at the height of the crosses like
a ball of lightning,

and one knows that it will not forgive.

It will not forgive what?

The sin of man and of the surrounding village,

and this is why several weeks before the rite you can see
the entire race of the Tarahumara purging themselves,
washing, and dressing in clean white garments.

And the Day of the Rite and of the blinding apparition has
finally arrived.

And now they are made to lie on the ground in their white
garments, the six men regarded as the purest of the
tribe.

And each is thought to have married a cross.

One of those crosses made of two sticks tied together with
a dirty cord.

‘And there is a seventh man who stands with a cross tied
to his hip, and in his hands is a bizarre musical instru-
ment made of many slats of wood laid one on top of the
other,

and the slats make a sound between a bell and a gun.



--- Page 53 ---

102 THE PEYOTE DANCE

And on a certain day, at dawn, the seventh Tutuguri opens

the dance by striking one of the slats with a deep black

iron mallet.

Then you see the men with the crosses, who have sprung
up as if out of the ground, leap forward in a circle, and
each must go around his cross seven times without
breaking the whole circle.

I do not know whether it is because the wind is rising,

or whether a wind rises from this music of another time
which is still alive today,

but one feels as if lashed by a gust of night, by a breath
that has risen from the burial vaults of a dead race that
has come to show its face here,

a painted face,

a face mocking and without mercy.

Without mercy because the justice that it brings is not of
this world.

Be pure and chaste,

it seems to say.

Be virginal too.

Or I will show you my Gehenna.

And Gehenna opens.

The wood harp of the seventh Tutuguri is now throbbing
horribly: it is the crater of a volcano at the height of its
eruption.

The slats seem to be breaking beneath the sounds like a
forest blasted by the ax of a fantastic woodcutter.

And suddenly what one was waiting for happens:

sulphurous fumes, lilac-laden, emerge in a mass from a
point in the circle

which the six men

TUTUGURI: THE RITE OF BLACK NIGHT 103

have traced,
which the six crosses
have enclosed,

and from beneath the fumes a flame, an enormous flame

suddenly

flashes,

and this enormous flame boils.

It boils with an unearthly sound. Its interior is filled with
stars, with incandescent bodies; as if the sun in coming
brought with it a celestial system.

And behold, the sun has taken its position.

It has formed in the middle of a celestial system. It has
suddenly placed itself as if at the center of a tremendous
explosion.

For the flaming bodies like the soldiers of an army at war
have fallen on each other, bursting.

Now the sun has become round. And one can see a ball of
flame on the same axis as the natural sun rise and leap
from cross to cross, for it is dawn.

The six men have opened their arms, not in the form of a
cross, but with their hands forward, as if trying to catch
the ball, and the ball, turning around each planted cross,
endlessly escapes. .

For the wood harp is a wind, it has become like the floor of
a wind over which an army could advance.

And so it does.

Now at the confines of the sound and of the void, for the
sound is so loud

That it calls forth nothing

but the void,

there is a violent stamping. The measured rhythm of an



--- Page 54 ---

104 THE PEYOTE DANCE

army on the march, or the galloping hoofs of a stam-
pede.

The flaming ball has burned the six crosses; the six men
with their hands held out who have seen the thing come
are all six

exhausted and amazed.

And the sound of galloping hoofs grows louder.

And on the horizon of crosses one sees a shape like a run-
away horse coming closer

with a naked man on top

for the beat of the rhythm was 7.

But there are only six crosses.

And in the wood harp of the seventh Tutuguri

always a beginning of nothingness

always this beginning of nothingness:

this empty beat,

an empty beat,

a kind of exhausting void between the slats of sharp wood,

a void calling the trunk of man,

the sawed-off torso of man

into the furor (not into the fervor)

of the things within.

There, where underneath the void

are chosen

the sound of great bells in the wind,

the rending of naval cannons,

the baying of waves in the tempests of the south;

there, the advancing horse bears the torso of a man,

a naked man who holds aloft

not a cross,

but a staff of ironwood,

TUTUGURI: THE RITE OF BLACK NIGHT 105

attached to a giant horseshoe
that encircles his whole body,
his body cut with a slash of blood,
and the horseshoe is there
like the jaws of an iron collar
which the man has caught
in the slash of his blood.
