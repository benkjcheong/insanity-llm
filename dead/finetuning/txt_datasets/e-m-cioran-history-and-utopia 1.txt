Letter to
a F araway Friend
From that country which was ours and now is no one's, you
urge me, after so many years of silence, to send you details
about my occupations, and about this "wonderful" world in
which, you say, I am lucky enough to live and move and
have my being. I might answer that I am a man without
occupation, and that this world is not in the least wonderful.
But so laconic a reply cannot, for all its exactitude, assuage
your curiosity or satisfy the many questions you raise. There
is one among them which, scarcely to be distinguished from
a reproach, strikes me more than all the rest: you ask if I
ever intend to return to our own language, or if I shall
remain faithful to this other tongue in which you (quite
gratuitously) attribute to me a facility I do not, and never
shall, possess. It would be the narrative of a nightmare, were
I to give you a detailed account of the history of my relations
with this borrowed idiom, with all these words so often
weighed, worked over, refined, subtle to the point of non­
existence, bowed beneath the exactions of nuance, inex­
pressive from having expressed everything, alarming in their
precision, burdened with fatigue and modesty, discreet even
in vulgarity. How should a Scyth come to terms with such
terms, grasp their true meaning and wield them with scruple,
1
2 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
with probity? There is not one among them whose ex­
hausted elegance fails to dizzy me: no longer a trace of earth,
of blood, of soul in such words. A syntax of severe, of
cadaverous dignity encompasses them and assigns them a
place from which God Himself could not dislodge them.
What consumption of coffee, of cigarettes, and of diction­
aries merely to write one halfway decent sentence in this
inapproachable language, too noble and too distinguished
for my taste! I realized as much, unfortunately, only after
the fact, when it was too late to change my course; otherwise
I should never have abandoned our own, whose odor of
growth and corruption I occasionally regret, that mixture
of sun and dung with all its nostalgic ugliness, its splendid
squalor. Return to it, I cannot; the tongue I was obliged to
adopt pinions and subjugates me by the very pains it has
cost me. Am I a "renegade," as you insinuate? "A man's
country is but a camp in the desert," says a Tibetan text. I
do not go so far and would give all the landscapes of the
world for that of my childhood. Yet I must add that, if I
make it into a paradise, the legerdemain or the infirmities
of my memory are exclusively responsible. Pursued by our
origins-we all are; the emotion mine inspire necessarily
translates itself into negative terms, the language of self­
punishment, of humiliation acknowledged and proclaimed,
of an accession to disaster. Is such patriotism answerable to
psychiatry? Perhaps, yet I cannot conceive of any other,
and, considering our destinies, it seems to me-why hide
it from you?-the only reasonable kind.
More fortunate than I, you have resigned yourself to our
natal dust; you possess, further, the faculty of enduring any
regime, including the most rigid varieties. Not that you lack
a nostalgia for caprice and chaos, but after all I know no
Letter to a Faraway Friend 3
mind more refractory than yours to the superstitions of
"democracy." There was a time, it is true, when I resisted
it as much as you do, perhaps more than you do: I was young
and could not admit other truths than mine, or concede to
an adversary the right to possess, to exercise, to impose his
own. That "sides," parties, could face yet not confound each
other was beyond my comprehension. Shame of the Race,
symbol of an anemic humanity without passions or convic­
tions, unfit for absolutes, unworthy of a future, limited at
every point, incapable of raising itself to the lofty wisdom
which taught me that the object of an argument was the
pulverization of the adversary-so I regarded the parlia­
mentary system. Those regimes, on the other hand, that
sought to eliminate and replace it seemed to me splendid
without exception, in harmony with the movement of Life,
my divinity in those days. If a man has not, by the time he
is thirty, yielded to the fascination of every form of extrem­
ism-I don't know whether he is to be admired or scorned,
regarded as a saint or a corpse. Lacking biological resources,
has he not located himself above or below time? Positive
or negative, the deficiency is no more than that. With neither
the desire nor the will to destroy, he is suspect, he has
triumphed over the demon or, more serious still, was never
possessed by one. To live in any true sense of the word is
to reject others; to accept them, one must be able to re­
nounce, to do oneself violence, to act against one's own
nature, to weaken oneself; we conceive freedom only for our­
selves-we extend it to our neighbors only at the cost of
exhausting efforts; whence the precariousness of liberalism,
a defiance of our instincts, a brief and miraculous success,
a state of exception, at the antipodes of our deepest im­
peratives. By our nature we are unsuited to it: only the
4 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
debilitation of our forces makes us accessible to it: tragedy
of a race which must debase itself on one hand to be en­
nobled on the other, and of which no member, unless by a
precocious decrepitude, sacrifices to "humane" principles.
Tolerance, the function of an extinguished ardor, of a dis­
equilibrium resulting not from an excess but from a dearth
of energy-tolerance cannot seduce the young. We do not
involve ourselves in political struggles with impunity; it is
to the cult of which the young were the object that our age
owes its bloodthirsty aspect: the century's convulsions em­
anate from them, from their readiness to espouse an aber­
ration and to translate it into action. Give them the hope
or the occasion of a massacre, they will follow you blindly.
At the end of adolescence, a man is a fanatic by definition;
I have been one myself, and to the limits of absurdity. Do
you remember that period when I poured out incendiary
tirades, less from a love of scandal than a longing to escape
a fever which, without the outlet of verbal dementia, would
certainly have consumed me? Convinced that the evils of
our society derived from old men, I conceived a liquidation
of every citizen over the age of forty, that onset of sclerosis
and mummification, that turning point after which, I chose
to believe, every individual becomes an insult to the nation
and a burden to the collectivity. So admirable did the project
seem to me that I did not hesitate to divulge it; those con­
cerned were something less than appreciative of its tenor
and labeled me a cannibal: my career as a public benefactor
began under discouraging auspices. You yourself, though
so generous and, in your way, so enterprising, by dint of
reservations and objections had persuaded me to give it up.
Was my project so blameworthy? It merely expressed what
every man who loves his country hopes for in his inmost
heart: the suppression of half his compatriots.
Letter to a Faraway Friend 5
When I think of those moments of enthusiasm and frenzy,
of the wild speculations that raddled and ravaged my mind,
I attribute them now not to dreams of philanthropy and
destruction, to the obsession with some unascertainable pu­
rity, but to an animal melancholy which, concealed beneath
the mask of fervor, functioned at my expense though I was
its willing accomplice, enchanted not to be obliged, like so
many others, to choose between the insipid and the atro­
cious. The atrocious falling to my portion, what more could
I ask? I had a wolfs soul, and my ferocity, feeding on itself,
satiated, flattered me: I was, in other words, the happiest
of lycanthropes. Glory I aspired to and shunned in one and
the same movement: once achieved, what is it worth, I re­
minded myself, from the moment it singles us out and im­
poses us only on the present and future generations, excludes
us from the past? What is the use of being known, if we
have not been so to this sage or that madman, to a Marcus
Aurelius or to a Nero? We shall never have existed for so
many of our idols, our name will have troubled none of the
centuries before us; and those that come after-what do they
matter? What does the future, that half of time, matter to
the man who is infatuated with eternity?
By what struggles I managed to rid myself of such mad­
ness I shall not tell you, it would take too long, requiring
one of those endless conversations that is, or was, a Balkan
secret. Whatever my difficulties, they were far from being
the sole cause of the change in my orientation; a more
natural and more painful phenomenon greatly contributed
to this: age, with its unmistakable symptoms. I began to
show more and more signs of tolerance, symptoms, it seemed
to me, of some inner upheaval, some doubtless incurable
disease. Worst of all I no longer had the strength to desire
my enemy's death; quite the contrary, I understood him, com-
6 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
pared his venom to my own: he existed and-nameless
downfall!-! was glad he existed. My hatreds, the source
of my exultations, died down, diminished from day to day,
and in departing carried off with them the best of myself.
What will I do? Into what abyss will I creep? I kept won­
dering. And in proportion as my energy waned, my penchant
for tolerance waxed; no doubt about it, I was no longer
young: others seemed conceivable to me, even real. I said
farewell to The Ego and Its Own; discretion tempted me: was
I done for? One must be, in order to become a sincere
democrat. To my delight, I realized that such was not exactly
my case, that I retained certain vestiges of fanaticism, some
traces of youth: I compromised none of my new principles,
I was an intractable liberal. I am still. 0 happy incompati­
bility, 0 saving absurdity! I sometimes aspire to set an ex­
ample as a perfect moderate: I congratulate myself at the
same time upon not succeeding, so greatly do I fear my own
dotage. The moment will come when, no longer fearing it,
I shall approach that ideal equilibrium I sometimes dream
of; and if, my friend, the years should lead you, as I hope,
to a downfall like mine, then perhaps, toward the century's
end, we shall sit side by side in our resuscitated parliament
and, one as senile as the other, may both bear witness to a
perpetual and enchanting spectacle. One becomes tolerant
only insofar as one loses one's vigor, as one collapses-oh,
charmingly!-into childhood, as one is too weary to torment
others whether out of love or out of hatred.
As you see, I take "broad" views. So broad I have no
idea where I stand on any problem at all. You shall judge
as much for yourself; to the question you ask: "Do you still
harbor your old prejudices against our little neighbor to the
west, do you still resent her as much?" I don't know what
Letter to a Faraway Friend 7
answer to give; at best I can dumbfound or disappoint you.
Because, of course, we do not have the same experience of
Hungary.
Born beyond the Carpathians, you could not know the
Hungarian policeman, terror of my Transylvanian child­
hood. When I so much as glimpsed one from afar, I was
panic-stricken and ran away: he was the alien, the enemy;
to hate was to hate him. Because of him, I abhorred all
Hungarians with a truly Magyar passion. In other words
they interested me. Subsequently, the circumstances having
changed, I no longer had any reason to hate them. But the
fact remains that long afterward I could not imagine an
oppressor without evoking their defects, their glories. Who
rebels, who rises in arms? Rarely the slave, but almost always
the oppressor turned slave. The Hungarians know tyranny
at close range, having wielded it with an incomparable pro­
ficiency: the minorities of the old monarchy could testify to
that. Because they were so gifted, in their past, in the role
of masters, they have been, in our own day, less disposed
than any other nation of central Europe to endure slavery;
if they had a talent for fiat, how could they fail to have one
for freedom? Strong in their tradition as persecutors, ac­
customed to the mechanism of subjugation and intolerance,
they have risen against a regime that has its similarities to
the one they themselves had reserved for other peoples.
But we, dear friend, not having had the occasion, hitherto,
of being oppressors, cannot now have that of being rebels.
Deprived of this double fortune, we bear our chains duti­
fully, and it would scarcely be gracious of me to deny the
virtues of our discretion, the nobility of our servitude, while
admitting nonetheless that the excesses of our modesty impel
us to disturbing extremes; so much discretion exceeds all
8 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
limits; it is so disproportionate that it sometimes manages
to discourage me. I envy, then, the arrogance of our neigh­
bors, I envy even their language, savage as it may be but of
a beauty that has nothing human about it, with sonorities
of another universe, powerful and corrosive, appropriate to
prayer, to groans and to tears, risen out of hell to perpetuate
its accent and its aura. Though I know only its swear words,
Hungarian never fails to delight me, I never tire of hearing
it, it enchants and repels me, I succumb to its charm and to
its horror, to all those words of nectar and cyanide, so suited
to the exigencies of an agony. It is in Hungarian that one
should expire-or renounce dying.
The fact is, I hate my former masters less and less. Upon
reflection, even in the days of their splendor, they were
always alone in the heart of Europe, isolated in their pride
and their regrets, lacking any profound affinities with the
other nations. After several incursions into the West, where
they could exhibit and expend their first savagery, they fell
back, conquerors degenerating into sedentaries, to the banks
of the Danube, there to sing, to lament, to erode their
instincts. There is, in these refined Huns, a melancholy con­
sisting of a suppressed cruelty, whose equivalent is not to
be found elsewhere: it is as if the blood began dreaming
about itself. And at last resolved itself into melody. Close
to their essence, though defiled and even branded by civi­
lization, conscious of descending from a unique horde,
stamped by a fatuousness both profound and theatrical which
affords them a style more romantic than tragic, how could
they disappoint the mission that fell to their lot in the mod­
ern world: to rehabilitate chauvinism, by introducing into
it enough pomp and fatality to make it picturesque to the
eyes of the disabused observer. I am all the more inclined
Letter to a Faraway Friend 9
co acknowledge their merits since it is they who have made
me suffer the worst humiliation, that of being born a serf,
as well as "pangs of shame"- the most intolerable of all,
according co one moralise. Have you yourself not experi­
enced the voluptuous pleasure to be taken in an effort of
objectivity toward chose who have flouted, scorned, mis­
treated you, especially when you secretly share their vices
and their miseries? Do not, from this, infer chat I long to
be promoted to the rank of Magyar. I am far from any such
presumption: I know my limits and intend to abide by them.
On the other hand, I also know those of our neighbor, and
should my enthusiasm for her drop, even one degree, ic
would suffice to disengage my vanity from the honor Hun­
gary did me by persecuting me.
Peoples, much more than individuals, inspire contradic­
tory sentiments; we love and loathe them at the same time;
objects of attachment and of aversion, they do not deserve
our harboring, in their behalf, a specific passion. Your par­
tiality to those of the West, whose defects you do not clearly
distinguish, is the effect of distance: an error of optics, or
a nostalgia for the inaccessible. Nor do you distinguish any
better the lacunae of bourgeois society; I even suspect you
of a certain leniency in its regard. That from such a distance
you should have a wonder-working view of it is natural
enough; since I know it ac close range, it is my duty to
combat the illusions you may entertain. Not that such a
society is entirely and absolutely displeasing to me-you
know my weakness for the horrible-but the expenditure
of insensitivity it requires in order to be endured is out of
all proportion co my reserves of cynicism. It is an under­
statement to say that in this society injustices abound: in
truth, it is itself the quintessence of injustice. Only the idle,
10 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
the parasite, the expert in turpitude, the great swindler, and
the petty crook profit by the benefits it bestows, the opu­
lence on which it prides itself: surface pleasures and surface
profusions. Under the shellac it shows off lies a world of
desolation whose details I shall spare you. Without the in­
tervention of a miracle, how explain that it does not reduce
itself to dust before our eyes, or that someone does not
blow it up instantaneously?
"Ours is worth no more; quite the contrary," you will
object. I agree. But there's the rub! We find ourselves deal­
ing with two types of society-both intolerable. And the
worst of it is that the abuses in yours permit this one to
persevere in its own, to offer its own horrors as a counter­
poise to those cultivated chez vous. The capital reproach one
can address to your regime is that it has ruined Utopia, a
principle of renewal in both institutions and peoples. The
bourgeoisie has understood the advantage to be derived
from this failure against the adversaries of the status quo;
the "miracle" which saves, which preserves it from an im­
mediate destruction, is precisely the debacle of the other
side, the spectacle of a great idea disfigured, the resulting
disappointment which, laying hold of men's minds, paralyzes
them. A really unhoped-for disappointment, a providential
support for the bourgeois who lives on it and from it extracts
the reason for his security. The masses are not stirred if
they have no more than a choice between present evils and
evils to come; resigned to those they suffer now, they have
no interest in risking themselves in the direction of others
which are unknown but certain. Foreseeable miseries do not
excite men's imaginations, and there is no example of a
revolution breaking out in the name of a dark future, a grim
prophecy. Who could have guessed, in the last century, that
Letter to a Faraway Friend 11
the new society would, by its vices and its iniquities, permit
the old one to preserve, even to consolidate itself; that the
possible, having become reality, would fly to the rescue of
the past?
On either side, we are at a nodal point, both fallen from
that naivete in which speculations on the future are elabo­
rated. In the long run, life without utopia is suffocating, for
the multitude at least: threatened otherwise with petrifac­
tion, the world must have a new madness. This is the one
piece of evidence to be gained from an analysis of the pres­
ent. Meanwhile, our situation on this side is certainly a
curious one. Imagine a society overpopulated with doubts;
in which, with the exception of a few strays, no one adheres
utterly to anything; in which, unscathed by superstitions and
certainties, everyone pays lip service to freedom and no one
respects the form of government that defends and incarnates
it. Ideals without content, or, to use a word quite as adul­
terated, myths without substance. You are disappointed after
promises that could not be kept; we, by a lack of any prom­
ises at all. At least we are aware of the advantage the in­
telligence gains from a regime that, for the moment, lets it
function as it will, without submitting it to the rigors of any
imperative. The bourgeois believes in nothing, true enough;
but this truth is, I daresay, the positive side of his vacuum,
for freedom can be manifested only in the void of beliefs,
in the absence of axioms, and only where the laws have no
more authority than a hypothesis. If you were to object that
the bourgeois nonetheless believes in something, that money
perfectly fulfills, for him, the function of a dogma, I should
reply that this worst of all dogmas is, strange as it may seem,
the one that is the most endurable for the mind. We forgive
others their wealth if, in exchange, they let us starve to
12 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
death in our own way. No, it is not so sinister, this society
which pays no attention to you, which abandons you, guar­
antees you the right to attack it, invites you, even obliges
you to do so in its hours of sloth when it lacks energy to
execrate itself. As indifferent, in the last instance, to its own
fate as to yours, it is in no way eager to infringe upon your
misfortunes, neither to reduce nor to aggravate them, and
if it exploits you, it does so by an automatism, without
premeditation or spite, as is appropriate to weary and sa­
tiated brutes that are as contaminated by skepticism as their
victims. The difference between regimes is less important
than it appears; you are alone by force, we without con­
straint. Is the gap so wide between an inferno and a ravaging
paradise? All societies are bad; but there are degrees, I
admit, and if I have chosen this one, it is because I can
distinguish among the nuances of trumpery.
Freedom, I was saying, demands, in order to manifest
itself, a vacuum; it requires a void-and succumbs to it. The
condition that determines it is the very one that annihilates
it. It lacks foundations; the more complete it is, the more
it overhangs an abyss, for everything threatens it, down to
the principle from which it derives. Man is so little made
to endure or deserve it, that the very benefits he receives
from it crush him, and freedom ultimately burdens him to
the point where he prefers, to its excesses, those of terror.
To these disadvantages are added others: a liberal society,
eliminating "mystery," "the absolute," "order," and pos­
sessing a true metaphysic no more than a true police, casts
the individual back upon himself, while dividing him from
what he is, from his own depths. If such a society lacks
roots, if it is essentially superficial, this is because freedom,
fragile in itself, has no means of maintaining itself, of sur-
Letter to a Faraway Friend 13
viving the dangers which threaten it from without and from
within; it appears, moreover, only in the twilight of a regime,
only at the moment when a class is declining, dissolving: it
was the collapse of the aristocracy that allowed the eigh­
teenth century to divagate so magnificently; it is the collapse
of the bourgeoisie that allows us today to cultivate our fan­
tasies. Freedoms prosper only in a sick body politic: toler­
ance and impotence are synonyms. This is patent in politics
as everywhere else. When I first glimpsed this truth, the
earth gave way under my feet. Even now, though I tell
myself: "You belong to a society of free men," the pride I
take in the fact is still accompanied by a sense of dread and
inanity, the result of my terrible certitude. In the course of
history, freedom occupies no more instants than ecstasy in
the life of a mystic. It escapes us at the very moment we
try to grasp and formulate it: no one can enjoy freedom
without trembling. Desperately mortal, once it is established
it postulates its lack of a future and labors on, with all its
undermined forces, to its own negation, its own agony. Is
there not a certain perversion in our love for it? And is it
not horrifying to worship what neither can nor cares to last?
For you who no longer possess it, freedom is everything;
for us who do, it is merely an illusion, because we know
that we shall lose it and that, in any case, it is made to be
lost. Hence, at the heart of our void, we cast our glances in
all directions, without thereby neglecting the possibilities
of salvation that reside in ourselves. There is, moreover, no
such thing as a perfect vacuum in history. That unheard-of
absence to which we are reduced, and which I have the
pleasure and the misfortune to reveal to you, you would be
mistaken to imagine merely a blank, uninscribed; for in it
I discern-presentiment or hallucination?-a kind of ex-
14 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
pectation of other gods. Which ones? No one can say. All I
know, and it is what everyone knows, is that a situation like
ours cannot be endured indefinitely. Deep within our con­
sciousness, one hope crucifies us, one apprehension exalts
us. Unless they assent to death, the old nations, however
rotten, cannot dispense with new idols. Whether or not the
West is irremediably corrupt, it must rethink all the ideas
stolen from it and applied (by counterfeiting them) else­
where: I mean that it is incumbent upon the West, if it seeks
to make itself illustrious once more by a throb or a vestige
of honor, to take back the utopias that, in its need for
comfort, it has abandoned to the others, thereby dispos­
sessing itself of its genius and its mission. Whereas it was
the West's duty to put communism into practice, to adjust
it to its traditions, to humanize, liberalize, and thereafter
propose it to the world, it has left to the East the privilege
of realizing the unrealizable, of deriving power and prestige
from the finest of our modern illusions. In the battle of
ideologies, the West has shown itself timid, harmless; some
congratulate it for this, whereas it is to be blamed: in our
day and age, one does not accede to hegemony without the
cooperation of those lofty, lying principles employed by
virile peoples to dissimulate their instincts and their aims.
Having abandoned reality for ideas, and ideas for ideology,
man has slid toward a derived universe, toward a world of
subproducts in which fiction acquires the virtues of a pri­
mordial datum. This process is the fruit of all the rebellions
and all the heresies of the West, yet the West refuses to
draw the final consequences: it has not initiated the revo­
lution that was its imperative, the revolution that its entire
past demanded, nor has it carried to their conclusion the
upheavals of which it was the instigator. By disinheriting
Letter to a Faraway Friend 15
itself in favor of its enemies, the West risks compromising
its denouement and missing a supreme opportunity. Not
content with having betrayed all those precursors, all those
schismatics who have prepared and formed it from Luther
to Marx, it still supposes that someone will come, from the
outside, to initiate its revolution, to bring back its utopias
and its dreams. Will the West ever understand that it has a
political destiny and a role only if it rediscovers in itself its
old dreams and its old utopias, as well as the lies of its old
pride? For the moment, it is the adversaries of the West
who, converted into theoreticians of the duty it evades, are
building their empires on its timidity, its lassitude. What
curse has fallen upon it that at the term of its trajectory it
produces only these businessmen, these shopkeepers, these
racketeers with their blank stares and atrophied smiles, to
be met with everywhere, in Italy as in France, in England
as in Germany? Is it with such vermin as this that a civili­
zation so delicate and so complex must come to an end?
Perhaps we had to endure this, out of abjection, in order
to be able to conceive of another kind of man. As a good
liberal, I do not want to carry indignation to the point of
intolerance or to let myself be carried away by my moods,
though it is sweet, for us all, to be able to infringe upon
the principles that appeal to our generosity. I merely wanted
to point out to you that our world, far from wonderful,
could in a sense become so if it consented not to annihilate
itself (as it inclines all too readily to do), but to liquidate its
failures by undertaking impossible tasks, opposed to that
dreadful good sense which is disfiguring and destroying it
today.
The feelings the West inspires in me are no less mixed
than those I entertain toward my country, toward Hungary,
16 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
or toward our big neighbor, whose indiscreet proximity you
are in a better position to appreciate than I. The excessive
good and bad I think of Russia, the impressions she suggests
when I reflect upon her destiny-how can I put such things
without falling into the preposterous? I make no claim to
change your opinion about her, I merely want you to know
what she represents for me and what place she occupies
among my obsessions. The more I think about her, the more
I find that Russia has formed herself, down through the
ages, not the way a nation is formed, but the way a universe
is formed, the moments of her evolution participating less
in history than in a somber, terrifying cosmogony. Those
tsars with their look of dried-up divinities, giants solicited
by sanctity and crime, collapsing into prayer and panic­
they were, as are these recent tyrants who have replaced
them, closer to a geological vitality than to human anemia,
despots perpetuating in our time the primordial sap, the
primordial spoilage, and triumphing over us all by their
inexhaustible reserves of chaos. Crowned or not, it was their
significance, as it is still, to leap beyond civilization, to engulf
it if need be; the operation was inscribed within their nature,
since they have always suffered from the same obsession:
to extend their supremacy over our dreams and our rebel­
lions, to constitute an empire as vast as our disappointments
or our dreads. Such a nation, coterminous both in its thoughts
and in its actions with the confines of the globe, does not
measure itself by present standards or explain itself in or­
dinary terms, in an intelligible language: it would require
the jargon of the Gnostics, enriched by that of a general
paralysis. Certainly it borders (has not Rilke assured us?)
on God; as it also does, unfortunately, on our own country,
and will again, in a more or less immediate future, on many
Letter to a Faraway Friend 17
others-I dare not say on all, despite the specific warnings
that a malignant prescience intimates. Wherever we are,
Russia already touches us, if not geographically, then with­
out a doubt internally. I am more disposed than any man I
know to acknowledge my debts to her: without her writers,
would I ever have grown aware of my wounds and of my
duty to surrender to them? Without her and without them,
would I not have wasted my agonies, missed out on my
chaos? This penchant which leads me to make an impartial
judgment upon her and at the same time to testify to my
gratitude is hardly, I fear, to your taste at the present time.
I therefore break off such unseasonable eulogies, stuffing
them inside myself where they will be condemned to be
fruitful and multiply.
Even in the days when we amused ourselves by tallying
our agreements and our differences, you reproached me for
my mania of judging without bias both what I take to heart
and what I execrate, of entertaining only double-neces­
sarily false-feelings which you imputed to my incapacity
to experience a true passion, while insisting on the delights
I derive from them. Your diagnosis was not inexact; yet you
erred with regard to the category of the delights. Do you
suppose it is so agreeable to be both idolater and victim of
the pro and the con, an enthusiast divided against his en­
thusiasms, a raving madman eager for objectivity? This does
not happen without sufferings: the instincts protest, and it
is indeed despite and against them that one advances toward
an absolute irresolution, a state scarcely distinct from what
the language of the ecstatics calls "the last point of annihi­
lation." In order to know, myself, the whole of my thoughts
about anything at all, in order to pronounce not only on a
problem but on a trifle, I must oppose the major vice of
18 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
my mind, that propensity to espouse all causes and at the
same time dissociate myself from them, a kind of omnipres­
ent virus divided between covetousness and satiety, a benign
yet deadly agent as impatient as it is blase, undecided be­
tween scourges, inept at adopting and specializing in one,
shifting from each to the other without discrimination or
effectiveness, bearer and bungler of the incurable, a traitor
to all diseases, those of others as to its own.
Never to have occasion to take a position, to make up
one's mind, or to define oneself-there is no wish I make
more often. But we do not always master our moods, those
attitudes in the bud, those rough drafts of theory. Viscerally
inclined to systems, we ceaselessly construct them, espe­
cially in politics, domain of pseudoproblems, breeding grounds
of the bad philosopher who resides in each of us, a realm
I would be exiled from for the most commonplace of rea­
sons, a piece of evidence which is raised in my eyes to the
rank of a revelation: politics revolves uniquely around man.
Having lost the taste for beings, I nonetheless wear myself
out in vain acquiring one for things; necessarily limited to
the interval that separates them, I expend and exhaust my­
self upon their shadow. Shadows too, these nations whose
fate intrigues me, less for themselves than for the pretext
they afford of revenging myself upon what has neither
form nor outline, upon entities and symbols. The idler who
loves violence safeguards his savoir vivre by confining him­
self in an abstract hell. Abandoning the individual, he frees
himself of names and faces, deals with the imprecise, the
general, and, orienting his thirst for exterminations to the
impalpable, conceives a n.ew genre: the pamphlet without
object.
Clinging to fractions of ideas and to figments of dreams,
Letter to a Faraway Friend 19
having arrived at reflection by accident or by hysteria, and
not at all by a concern for rigor, I seem to myself, among
civilized men, a kind of intruder, a troglodyte enamored of
decrepitude, plunged into subversive prayers, victim of a
panic that emanates not from a vision of the world but from
the spasms of the flesh and the tenebrae of the blood. Im­
permeable to the solicitations of clarity and to the Latin
contamination, I feel Asia stirring in my veins: am I the
offspring of some inadmissible tribe, or the spokesman of
a race once turbulent, today mute? Often the temptation
seizes me to forge for myself another genealogy, to change
ancestors, to choose among those who, in their day, spread
grief among the nations, contrary to my own, to our modest
and martyred land stuffed with miseries, amalgamated to
the mud and groaning beneath the anathema of the ages.
Yes, in my crises of fatuity, I incline to believe myself the
epigone of some horde illustrious for its depredations, a
Turanian at heart, legitimate heir of the steppes, the last
Mongol. . . .
I would not end here without once again warning you
against the enthusiasm or the jealousy my "luck" inspires
in you, specifically the opportunity to loll in a city whose
memory doubtless haunts you, despite your roots in our
evaporated country. This city, which I would exchange for
no other in the world, is for that very reason the source of
my misfortunes. All that is not Paris being equal in my eyes,
I often regret that wars have spared it, that it has not per­
ished like so many others. Destroyed, it would have rid me
of the happiness of living here, I could have spent my days
elsewhere, at the ends of the earth. I shall never forgive
Paris for having bound me to space, for making me from
somewhere. Mind you, I am not forgetting for a moment
20 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
that four-fifths of its inhabitants, as Chamfort has already
noted, "die of grief." I should add further, for your edifica­
tion, that the remaining fifth, the privileged few of whom
I am one, are no different in their feelings, and that they
even envy that majority its advantage of knowing of what
to die.
Russia and
the Virus of Libert
y
Every country, I sometimes think, should be like Switzer­
land-should complacently subside into hygiene, insipidity,
the worship of laws, and the cult of humanity; at other times
I admire only nations untouched by scruple in thought or
deed, feverish and insatiable, ever ready to devour others
and themselves, riding roughshod over all values opposed
to their ascent and their success, scornful of prudence, that
plague of superannuated peoples weary of themselves as of
all the rest and apparently captivated by the smell of mold.
In the same way, if I abominate tyrants, I nonetheless see
that they constitute the warp of history, and that without
them the idea or the course of an empire would be incon­
ceivable. Superlatively odious, of an inspired bestiality, they
suggest man driven to his limits, the ultimate exasperation
of his turpitudes and his virtues. Ivan the Terrible, to cite
only the most fascinating among them, exhausts every nook
and cranny of psychology: as complex in his madness as in
his politics, having made his reign, and to a certain degree
his country, into a model nightmare, prototype of a per­
ennial hallucination, a mixture of Mongolia and Byzantium,
combining the qualities and the defects of a khan and a
basileus, a monster of demoniac rages and sordid dejection,
21
22 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
torn between bloodthirstiness and remorse, his joviality en­
riched with taunts and crowned with sneers, he had a passion
for crime; as have we all, insofar as we exist: transgressions
against others or ourselves. Only in us it remains unslaked,
that passion, so that our works, whatever they may be, derive
from our incapacity to kill or to kill ourselves. We do not
always acknowledge as much, we are glad to ignore the cozy
mechanism of our infirmities. If I am obsessed by the tsars
or the Roman emperors, it is because such infirmities, con­
cealed in us, show quite plainly in them. They reveal us to
ourselves, they incarnate and illustrate our secrets. I think
especially of those who, doomed to an awesome degener­
ation, turned on their own and, fearing to be loved by them,
sent them to their doom. They were powerful, yet they
were wretched, unsatiated by the terror of others. Are they
not a sort of projection of the evil genius that dwells in us
all and tempts us to believe we must leave nothing standing
around us? It is with such thoughts and such instincts that
an empire is formed: in it cooperates that subsoil of our
consciousness in which are hidden our dearest faults.
Emerging from unsoundable depths, possessed of an original
vitality, the ambition to rule the world appears only in cer­
tain individuals and at certain periods, without direct rela­
tion to the quality of the nation in which it is manifested:
the difference between Napoleon and Genghis Khan is less
than between the former and any French politician of the
subsequent republics. But these depths, like this impulse,
can be exhausted-can run dry.
Charlemagne, Frederick II von Hohenstaufen, Charles
V, Bonaparte, Hitler were tempted, each in his own way,
to realize the idea of universal empire; they failed to do so,
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 23
more or less fortunately. The West, where this idea no
longer inspires anything but irony or uneasiness, now lives
in shame of its conquests; but oddly enough, it is precisely
when the West retreats that its formulas triumph and spread;
turned against Western power and Western supremacy, they
find an echo outside Western frontiers. The West wins by
losing. This was how Greece prevailed in the realm of the
mind, once she had ceased being a power and even a nation;
her philosophy and her arts were pilfered, her productions
won a certain victory, without her talents being assimilable;
in the same way, the West is-will be-stripped of every­
thing, except its genius. A civilization proves its fecundity
by its talent to incite others to imitate it; when it no longer
dazzles them, it is reduced to an epitome of vestiges and
shards.
Abandoning this corner of the world, the notion of em­
pire would find a providential climate in Russia, where it
has always existed, moreover-singularly on the spiritual
level. After the fall of Byzantium, Moscow became, for the
Orthodox consciousness, the third Rome, heir of the "true"
Christianity, the true faith. First messianic awakening. The
second had to wait until our own day and age; but that
awakening is due, this time, to the resignation of the West.
In the fifteenth century, Russia profited by a religious void,
as she profits today by a political one. Two major oppor­
tunities to absorb her historical responsibilities.
When Mahomet II lay siege to Constantinople, Chris­
tendom, divided as always and delighted, moreover, to have
lost all memory of the Crusades, declined to intervene. At
first the besieged city expressed a certain irritation which,
as the disaster came into focus, turned to stupor. Oscillating
between panic and a secret satisfaction, the pope promised
24 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
aid, which came too late: what was the use of taking so much
trouble for "schismatics"? The "schism," however, was to
gain strength elsewhere. Did Rome prefer Moscow to By­
zantium? A distant enemy is always preferable to the one
at the gate. In the same way, in our own times, the British
would opt for a Russian preponderance in Europe over a
German one. Germany was too close.
Russia's claims to turn from vague primacy to distinct he­
gemony are not unfounded. What would have become of
the West if she had not halted and absorbed the Mongol
invasion? For over two centuries of humiliation and servi­
tude, Russia was excluded from history, while the Western
nations indulged themselves in the luxury of tearing each
other to pieces. Had Russia been in a condition to develop
unhampered, she would have become a first-rate power on
the eve of modern times; what she is now she would have
been in the sixteenth or seventeenth century. And the West?
Perhaps today the West would be Orthodox, and Rome would
enthrone not the Holy See but the Holy Synod. But the
Russians can still catch up. If they manage, as there is every
reason to expect, to execute their plans, it is not out of the
question that they will arrange matters with the sovereign
pontiff. Whether in the name of Marxism or of Orthodoxy,
they are fated to foil the Church's authority and prestige­
they cannot tolerate its aims without abdicating the essential
point of their mission and their program. U oder the tsars,
identifying the Church with an instrument of Antichrist,
they offered prayers against it; now, holding it to be a Sa­
tanic tool of Reaction, they overwhelm it with invectives
rather more effective than their old anathemas; soon they
will overcome it with all their weight and all their power.
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 25
And it is not at all impossible that our age may count among
its curiosities, and in the form of a frivolous apocalypse, the
disappearance of St. Peter's last successor.
By sanctifying History in order to discredit God, Marxism
has merely rendered Him more peculiar and more haunting.
You can stifle every impulse in humanity except the need
for an Absolute, which will survive the destruction of tem­
ples and even the disappearance of religion on earth. The
core of the Russian people being religious, they will inev­
itably gain the upper hand. Reasons of a historical order will
have a good deal to do with this triumph.
By adopting Orthodoxy, Russia manifested her desire to
stand apart from the West; it was her way of defining herself,
from the start. Never, outside certain aristocratic circles,
did she let herself be seduced by the Catholic-as it hap­
pened, Jesuit-missionaries. A schism does not express the
divergencies of doctrine so much as a will to ethnic affir­
mation: what appears in it is less an abstract controversy
than a national reflex. It was not the absurd question of the
filioque that divided the churches: Byzantium wanted its total
autonomy; Moscow a fortiori. Schisms and heresies are na­
tionalisms in disguise. But whereas the Reformation merely
assumed the appearance of a family quarrel, of a scandal
within the West, Orthodox particularism, acquiring a more
profound character, was to mark a division from the Wes tern
world itself. By rejecting Catholicism, Russia delayed her
evolution, lost a crucial opportunity for civilizing herself
rapidly, while gaining in substance and in unity; her stag­
nation rendered her different, made her other; this is what
she aspired to, doubtless foreseeing that the West would
one day regret its head start.
26 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
The stronger Russia became, the more aware she grew
of her roots, from which, in some sense, Marxism will have
alienated her; after a forced cure of universalism, she will
re-Russify, in favor of Orthodoxy. And, moreover, she will
have stamped Marxism with a distinctly Slavic character:
Marxism enSlaved . . . . A ny nation of a certain scope that
adopts an ideology alien to its traditions will adapt and de­
nature it, inflect it in the direction of its own national des­
tiny, distort it to its own advantage, ultimately rendering it
indistinguishable from its own genius. A people possesses
a necessarily distorting optic all its own, a defect of vision
which, far from disconcerting it, flatters and stimu­
lates . . . . T he truths it avails itself of, whatever they may
lack in objective value, are nonetheless vital and produce,
as such, the kinds of errors that constitute the diversity of
the historical landscape, granted that the historian-skep­
tical by metier, temperament, and option-is stationed, from
the start, outside of Truth.
While the Western nations exhausted themselves in their
struggle for freedom and, still more, in that freedom once
acquired (nothing is so wearing as the possession or the
abuse of liberty), the Russian people was suffering without
self-expenditure; for one expends oneself only in history,
and since the Russians were excluded from history, they
were obliged to submit to the infallible systems of despotism
inflicted upon them: an obscure, vegetative existence which
allowed them to gain strength, to accumulate energy, to
amass reserves, and to draw from their servitude the max­
imum of biological advantage. In this, Orthodoxy was agreat
help-but a popular Orthodoxy, admirably articulated to
keep that people apart from the course of events and op­
posed to the official Orthodoxy which oriented the govern-
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 27
ment toward imperialist aims. The double face of the
Orthodox Church: on the one hand it militated in favor of
the somnolence of the masses; on the other, as an auxiliary
of the tsars, it wakened popular ambitions and made possible
enormous conquests in the name of a passive population.
Fortunate passivity, which assured the Russians their present
predominance, fruit of their historical belatedness. Whether
favorable or hostile to them, all of Europe's enterprises
hinge on them; once she puts them at the heart of her
interests and her anxieties, she acknowledges that they have
the potential to dominate her. Thus is virtually realized one
of the Russians' oldest dreams. That they have attained it
under the auspices of an ideology of foreign provenance
adds the spice of a further paradox to their success. What
matters, finally, is that the regime be Russian, and entirely
in the traditions of the country. Is it not revealing that the
Revolution, a direct product of Occidentalist theories, was
increasingly oriented toward Slavophile ideas? Moreover, a
people represents not so much an aggregate of ideas and
theories as of obsessions: those of Russians, whatever their
political complexion, are always, if not identical, at least
related. A Tchaadaev who found no virtue in his country
or a Gogol who mocked it pitilessly was just as attached to
it as a Dostoevsky. The most extreme of the Nihilists, Net­
chaiev, was quite as obsessed by it as Pobiedonostsev, pro­
curator of the Holy Synod and a reactionary through and
through. Only this obsession counts. The rest is merely
attitude.
For Russia to adapt to a liberal regime, she would have to
weaken considerably-her vigor would have to decline; bet­
ter still: she would have to lose her specific character and
28 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
denationalize in depth. How would she manage this, with
her unbroached internal resources and her thousand years
of autocracy? Even if she were to achieve such a thing in
one bound, she would instantly disintegrate. Even more than
a nation, an empire, if it is to survive and to flourish, requires
a certain dose of terror. France herself could invest in de­
mocracy only when her springs were beginning to loosen,
only when, no longer seeking hegemony, she was preparing
to become prudent and respectable. Her First Empire was
her final folly. Thereupon, accessible to liberty, she would
become painfully accustomed to it, through a number of
convulsions, unlike England, which-a bewildering exam­
ple-had free relations of long standing, without shocks or
dangers, thanks to the conformism and the enlightened stu­
pidity of her citizens (the country has not produced, to my
knowledge, a single anarchist).
In the long run, time favors the fettered nations which,
amassing forces and illusions, live in the future, in hope;
but what can be hoped for in freedom-or in the regime
which incarnates it, constituted of dissipation, serenity, and
spinelessness? A marvel that has nothing to offer, democ­
racy is at once a nation's paradise and its tomb. Life has
meaning only in democracy, yet she lacks life . . . . I mmediate
happiness, imminent disaster-inconsistency of a regime to
which one does not adhere without falling on the horns of
an agonizing dilemma.
Better furnished, more fortunate, Russia need not face
such problems, absolute power being for her, as Karamzin
already remarked, the "very basis of her being." Ever as­
piring to freedom without ever attaining it-is this not her
great superiority over the West, which, alas! has long since
attained to it? Russia, moreover, is not ashamed of her em-
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 29
pire; quite the contrary, she dreams only of extending it.
Who more than Russia has hastened to profit by the ac­
quisitions of other peoples? The achievements of Peter the
Great, even those of the Revolution, participate in an in­
spired parasitism. And it is true that she endured even the
horrors of the Tartar yoke with a certain ingenuity.
If, while confined in a calculated isolation, Russia has
managed to imitate the West, she has managed even better
to be admired by that West and to seduce some of its best
minds. The Encyclopedists were infatuated by the schemes
of Peter and Catherine, just as the heirs of the Enlighten­
ment (I mean the Left) were to be infatuated with those of
Lenin and Stalin. This phenomenon argues in favor of Rus­
sia, but not of the Westerners who, complicated and ravaged
to the last degree and seeking "progress" elsewhere, outside
themselves and their creations, today find themselves par­
adoxically closer to Dostoevsky's characters than do the
Russians themselves. Yet we might observe that they evoke
only the defeated aspects of these same characters, that they
possess neither their ferocious obsessions nor their virile
sulks: so many "possessed" men, weakened by ratiocination
and scruples, eroded by subtle remorse, by a thousand in­
terrogations, martyrs of doubt, dazzled and annihilated by
their own perplexities . . . .
Each civilization believes that its way of life is the only right
one and the only one conceivable-that it must convert the
world to it or inflict it upon the world; its way of life is
equivalent to an explicit or camouflaged soteriology; indeed,
to an elegant imperialism, but one that ceases to be so as
soon as it is accompanied by military enterprise. You do
not found an empire by whim. You subjugate others so they
30 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
will imitate you, so they will model themselves on you, on
your beliefs and your habits; then comes the perverse im­
perative to make slaves out of them in order to contemplate
therein the flattering or caricatural sketch of yourself. I grant
that there is such a thing as a qualitative hierarchy of em­
pires: the Mongols and the Romans did not subjugate peo­
ples for the same reasons, and their conquests did not have
the same result. It is nonetheless true that they were equally
expert in doing away with their adversary by reducing him
to their own image.
Whether she has provoked or suffered, then, Russia has
never been content with mediocre misfortunes. The same
will be true of her future: she will fall upon Europe by a
physical fatality, by the automatism of her mass, by her
superabundant and morbid vitality so propitious to the gen­
eration of an empire (in which a nation's megalomania is
always materialized), by that health of hers, crammed with
the unforeseen, with horrors and enigmas, allocated to the
service of a messianic idea, rudiment and prefiguration of
all conquests. When the Slavophiles asserted that Russia
must save the world, they were employing a euphemism:
one hardly saves a world without ruling it. As for a nation,
it finds its life-principle in itself or nowhere: how would it
be saved by another? Russia still thinks-secularizing the
Slavophiles' language and their conception-that it is her
task to ensure the world's safety, the West's first of all,
toward which, moreover, she has never experienced a clear­
cut feeling, only attraction and repulsion, and jealousy (that
jumble of secret worship and ostensible aversion) inspired
by the spectacle of a corruption as enviable as it is dangerous,
contact with which is to be sought-but still more to be
shunned.
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 31
Reluctant to define himself and to accept limits, culti­
vating ambiguity in politics, in morals, and, more seriously,
in geography, with none of the na1vetes inherent in "civilized
men" rendered opaque to reality by the excesses of a ra­
tionalist tradition, the Russian, subtle by intuition as much
as by the age-old experience of dissimulation, is perhaps a
child historically, but in no case psychologically; whence his
complexity as a man of young instincts and old secrets­
whence too the contradictions, exacerbated to grotesquerie,
of his attitudes. When he decides to be profound (and he
succeeds quite effortlessly), he disfigures the slightest fact,
the merest idea. It is as if he has the mania of a monumental
grimace. Everything is dizzying, dreadful, and ineffable in
the history of his ideas, revolutionary or otherwise. He is
still an incorrigible amateur of utopias; now, utopia is the
grotesque en rose, the need to associate happiness-that is,
the improbable-with becoming, and to coerce an optimis­
tic, aerial vision to the point where it rejoins its own source:
the very cynicism it sought to combat. In short, a monstrous
fantasy.
That Russia is in a position to realize her dream of a
universal empire is a likelihood but not a certitude; on the
other hand, it is patent that Russia can conquer and annex
all Europe, and even that she will proceed to do so, if only
to reassure the rest of the world . . . . She is content with so
little! Where to find a more convincing proof of modesty,
of moderation? The tip of a continent! Meanwhile, she con­
templates it with the same eye with which the Mongols
regarded China and the Turks Byzantium-with this dif­
ference, though, that she has already assimilated a good
many Western values, whereas the Tartar and Ottoman hordes
had only a wholly material superiority over their future prey.
32 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
It is doubtless regrettable that Russia has not passed through
the Renaissance: all her inequalities derive from that. But
with her gift for making up time, she will be, in a century,
perhaps in less, as refined, as vulnerable as that post-Ren­
aissance West, at a level of civilization that can be outdone
only by descending. History's supreme ambition is to record
the variations of this level. Russia's, inferior to that of Eu­
rope, can only rise, and Russia with it: which is as much as
to say that she is doomed to ascent. By rising, however,
does she not risk, unbridled as she is, losing her equilibrium,
bursting into ruins? With her millions of souls kneaded by
sects and by steppes, she gives a singular impression of space
and of claustration, of immensity and of suffocation, of the
North in short, but of a special North, one irreducible to
our analyses, a North marked by a sleep and a hope that
make us tremble, by a night rich in explosions, by a dawn
we shall remember. No Mediterranean transparency and
gratuitousness in these Hyperboreans whose past, like their
present, seems to belong to a different duration from ours.
Facing the West's fragility and renown, they experience an
embarrassment, the consequence of their belated awakening
and of their unemployed vigor: this is the inferiority com­
plex of the strong. . . . T hey will escape it, they will overcome
it. The sole point of light in our future is their nostalgia­
so secret and so intense-for a delicate world of deliques­
cent charms. If they accede to it (as appears to be the obvious
direction of their fate) they will be civilized at the expense
of their instincts and-delightful prospect-they too will
be infected with the virus of liberty.
The more humane an empire becomes, the more readily
there develop within it the contradictions by which it will
perish. Of composite demeanor, of heterogeneous structure
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 33
(the converse of a nation, chat organic reality), an empire
requires, to subsist, the cohesive principle of terror. If it
lays itself open co tolerance, chat "virtue" will destroy its
unity and its power, and will act upon it in the manner of
a deadly poison it has administered to itself. This is because
tolerance is not only the pseudonym of freedom, but also
of mind; and mind, even more deadly to empires than to
individuals, erodes them, compromises their solidity, and
accelerates their collapse. Hence it is the very instrument
an ironic providence employs to destroy them.
If, despite the arbitrariness of the attempt, we were co divert
ourselves by establishing zones of vitality in Europe, we should
discover that the farther east we move, the more evident
instinct becomes, and the less noticeable as we head west.
The Russians are far from possessing an exclusive claim to
it, though even the other nations that possess instinct belong
in varying degrees to the Soviet sphere of influence. These
nations have not spoken their last word, far from it; some
of them, like Poland or Hungary, have played a not negli­
gible part in history; others, like Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and
Rumania, having lived in the shadows, have endured only
short-lived convulsions. But whatever their past has been,
and independently of their level of civilization, they all still
possess a biological capital it would be futile co seek in the
West. Mistreated, disinherited, cast into an anonymous mar­
tyrdom, pinioned between sloth and sedition, they may yet
know a coming compensation for so many ordeals, so many
humiliations, and even so many cowardices. The degree of
instinct is not measured from outside; co determine its in­
tensity, we must have frequented (or divined) these coun­
tries, the only ones in the world still to espouse, in their
34 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
splendid blindness, the destinies of the West. Imagine our
continent incorporated into the Russian empire, then imag­
ine that empire-too vast, weakening and falling apart, and
as a corollary, imagine the emancipation of its peoples: which
among them will gain supremacy and supply Europe with
that surfeit of impatience and power without which an ir­
remediable stupor awaits her? I cannot doubt the answer:
it is those I have just mentioned. Given the reputation they
enjoy, my assertion will seem ludicrous. Central Europe,
just possibly . . . B ut the Balkans? -I don't want to defend
them, nor do I want to pass over their virtues in silence.
That taste for devastation, for internal clutter, for a universe
like a brothel on fire, that sardonic outlook on ancient or
imminent cataclysms, that pungency, that far niente of the
insomniac or the assassin-is it nothing, then, an inheritance
so rich and so burdensome, one that will thus empower
those who come into it? And who, stamped with a "soul,"
will thereby prove that they preserve a residue of savagery?
Insolent and despairing, they will choose to wallow in glory,
the appetite for which is inseparable from the will to self­
assertion and collapse, from the penchant for a/ast twilight.
If their words are virulent, their accents inhuman and oc­
casionally ignoble, this is because a thousand reasons impel
them to howl louder than civilized men who have exhausted
their cries. The last "primitives" in Europe, they may give
her a new energy, which she will not fail to regard as her
last humiliation. And yet, if the Balkans were no more than
horror, why is it, when we leave them and make for this
part of the world, why is it we feel a kind of fall-an ad­
mirable one, it is true-into the abyss?
Life in depth, the secret existence of peoples who, enjoying
the enormous advantage of having so far been rejected by
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 35
history, could capitalize their dreams-that buried existence
doomed to the miseries of a resurrection begins on the other
side of Vienna, a geographical extremity of Western deca­
dence. Austria, whose erosion borders on the symbolic or
the comical, prefigures Germany's fate. No sizable extrav­
agance is left to the Germans, no further mission of frenzy,
nothing to make them alluring or odious! Predestined bar­
barians, they destroyed the Roman Empire so that Europe
could be born; having created it, they were appointed to
destroy it; vacillating with them, Europe undergoes the re­
coil of their exhaustion. Whatever dynamism they still pos­
sess, they no longer have what underlies all energy, or what
justifies it. Doomed to insignificance, budding Helvetians,
forever banished from their habitual excess, reduced to
brooding over their degraded virtues and their diminished
vices, with, as their sole hope, the resource of being a me­
diocre tribe, the Germans are unworthy of the fear they still
inspire: to believe in them or to be in dread of them is to
do them an honor they scarcely deserve. Their failure was
Russia's providence. Had they succeeded, she would have
been sidetracked, for at least a century, from her great aims.
But they could not succeed, for they attained to the peak
of their material power at the very moment when they had
nothing more to offer, when they were strong and empty.
The hour had already struck for others. "Are not the Slavs
the ancient Germans, with regard to the world which is dis­
appearing?" asked Herzen in the middle of the last cen­
tury-Herzen, the most perspicacious and lacerated of the
Russian liberals, a mind of prophetic interrogations, dis­
gusted by his own country, disappointed by the West, as
unlikely to settle in a patrie as in a problem, though he loved
to speculate on the life of peoples, a vague and inexhaustible
subject, an emigre's pastime. Yet peoples, according to an-
36 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
other Russian, Soloviev, are not what they imagine them­
selves to be, but what God thinks of them in His eternity.
I have no information as to God's opinion of the Germans
and the Slavs; nonetheless I know He has favored the latter,
and that it is quite as futile to congratulate Him on the fact
as to upbraid Him for it.
Today it is settled, that question so many Russians asked
about their country in the last century: "Was this colossus
created for nothing?" The colossus certainly has a meaning,
and what a meaning! An ideological map would show that
it extends beyond its borders, that it establishes its frontiers
where it pleases, and that its presence evokes everywhere
the notion less of a crisis than of an epidemic, salutary some­
times, frequently ruinous, always lightninglike.
The Roman Empire was the enterprise of a city; England's
was established to remedy the exiguity of an island; Ger­
many sought to build hers in order not to smother in an
overpopulated territory. An unparalleled phenomenon, Russia
was to justify her projected expansion in the name of her
vast spaces. "The moment I have enough, why not have too
much?" Such is the implicit paradox of both her proclama­
tions and her silences. By converting infinity into a political
category, she would overturn the classical concept and the
traditional contexts of imperialism and provoke throughout
the world a hope too great not to degenerate into chaos.
With her ten centuries of terrors, of shadows and promises,
Russia was more likely than all others to adapt to the night
side of our historical moment. Apocalypse suits her won­
derfully, she has the habit of it, the taste for it, and functions
within it today better than ever, since she has visibly changed
rhythm. "Where are you rushing, 0 Russia?" Gogol already
Russia and the Virus of Liberty 37
asked, perceiving the frenzy she concealed under her ap­
parent immobility. We know where now, and above all we
know that like all nations of an imperial destiny, she is more
impatient to solve the problems of others than her own.
Which is to say that our career in time depends on what she
will decide or will undertake: she holds our future in her
hands . . . . F ortunately for us, time does not exhaust our
substance. The indestructible, the Elsewhere are conceiv­
able: in us? apart from us? How can we tell? The fact remains
that as things are now, only questions of strategy and meta­
physics deserve our interest, those that rivet us to history
and those that wrench us from it: actuality and the absolute,
the newspapers and the Gospels . . . . I foresee the day when
we shall read nothing but telegrams and prayers. A re­
markable phenomenon: the more our immediacy absorbs
us, the more we feel the need to offset it, so that we live,
in one and the same moment, within the world and outside
it. Hence, when we confront the sideshow of empires, all
that remains for us to do is seek a middle term between the
skull's grin and serenity.
Learning
from the Tyrants
Whoever has not known the temptation to be first in the
city will understand nothing of how politics work, nothing
of the passion to reduce others to the status of objects, and
will never grasp the elements that constitute the art of con­
tempt. Rare are those who have not suffered a thirst for
power to some degree: it is natural to us, and yet, upon
close consideration, it assumes all the characteristics of a
morbid state from which we recover only accidentally or by
some internal maturation, like the kind that occurred in
Charles V when, abdicating at Brussels at the height of his
glory, he taught the world that excessive lassitude could
provoke scenes as admirable as excessive courage. But
whether anomaly or marvel, renunciation, that challenge to
our norms, to our identity, crops up only at exceptional
inoments, a limit-case that delights the philosopher and
dumbfounds the historian.
Examine yourself when you are a prey to ambition, in­
fected by its fever; then dissect your "fits." You will discover
that they are preceded by strange symptoms, by a particular
warmth which will not fail to overpower and alarm you.
Future-sodden by abuse of hope, you suddenly feel re­
sponsible for now and what is to come, at the heart of a
38
Learning from the Tyrants 39
duration answerable to your every frisson and along with
which-agent of a universal anarchy-you dream of ex­
ploding. Attentive to the events of your brain and the vi­
cissitudes of your blood, brooding over your breakdown,
you wait for its signs and cherish every one. Source of dis­
orders, of peerless maladies, political mania, if it floods the
intelligence, on the other hand favors the instincts and plunges
you into a salutary chaos. The notion of the good and par­
ticularly of the evil you imagine you can accomplish will
gladden and exalt you; and such will be the tour de force,
the marvel of your infirmities, that they will set you up as
master of everyone and everything.
Around you, you will notice an analogous breakdown in
those eroded by the same passion. As long as they are under
its spell, they will be unrecognizable, victims of an intoxi­
cation unlike any other. The very timbre of their voice,
everything in them will change. Ambition is a drug that
makes its addicts potential madmen. These stigmata, that
lost-dog expression, those anxious features which seem to
be twitching with a sordid ecstasy-if you haven't spotted
them in yourself or in others, you will remain a stranger to
the woes and wonders of Power, that tonic Hell, synthesis
of poison and panacea.
Now imagine the converse process. The fever gone, lo!
you are exorcised, normal to excess. No more ambition, hence
no means of being someone or something; nothing person­
ified, the void incarnate: glands and viscera clairvoyant, bones
disabused, a body invaded by lucidity, pure of itself, out of
the running and outside of time, hung upon a self fixed in
a total knowledge without acquaintances. This moment van­
ished, where will you rediscover it-who will restore it to
you? Everywhere men frenzied, men bewitched, a throng
40 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
of deviants whom reason has deserted in order to take refuge
in you, in the only one who has understood everything,
absolute spectator lost among dupes, forever refractory to
the unanimous farce. The interval which separates you from
the rest incessantly widening, you come to wonder if you
haven't perceived some reality hidden from everyone else.
An infinitesimal or a crucial revelation, its content will re­
main obscure to you. The one thing you are sure of is your
accession to a wholly new equilibrium, promotion of a mind
free of all complicity with others. Unduly sane, more poised
than all the sages, so you appear to yourself. . . . A nd if you
still resemble the madmen around you, you feel that a trifle
will distinguish you from them forever; imbued with this
sensation or this illusion, even if you perform the same
actions as other men, you do so without the same enthu­
siasm, the same conviction. Cheating will be for you a ques­
tion of honor, and the only way of conquering your "fits"
or of preventing their recurrence. If it has required nothing
more or less than a revelation, or a collapse, you will deduce
that those who have not suffered a crisis of this kind will
sink ever deeper into the extravagances inherent in our race.
Have you noted the symmetry? In order to become a
politician, that is, in order to have the stuff of a tyrant, a
certain mental derangement is necessary; to cease being so,
another derangement is no less in order: is it not a question,
after all, of transforming our Jolie des grandeurs? To shift
from wanting to be first in the city to wanting to be last, is,
by a mutation of pride, to trade a dynamic madness for a
static one, an extraordinary genre of insanity, as extraor­
dinary as the renunciation which originates in it and which,
answering to ascesis rather than to politics, has nothing to
do with our subject.
Learning from the Tyrants 41
For thousands of years, the appetite for power being dis­
persed in countless tyrannies, great and small, which have
raged here and there, the moment seems at hand when that
appetite must finally collect and concentrate in order to
culminate in a single power, expression of that thirst which
has devoured, which still devours the globe, last word of all
our dreams of mastery, the consummation of our hopes and
our aberrations. The scattered human herd will be united
under the guardianship of one pitiless shepherd, a kind of
planetary monster before whom the nations will prostrate
themselves in an alarm bordering on ecstasy. The universe
brought to its knees, an important chapter of history will
be closed. Then will begin the disintegration of this new
reign and the return to the primal disorder, to the old an­
archy; the smothered hates and vices will reappear and with
them the minor tyrants of the bygone cycles. After the Great
Slavery, mediocre ones. But as they emerge from their mon­
umental servitudes, the survivors will be proud of their
shame and of their fear and, incomparable victims, will cel­
ebrate its memory.
Diirer is my prophet. The more I observe the procession
of the centuries, the more I am convinced that the one image
capable of revealing its meaning is that of his Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse. The ages advance only by treading the
hordes underfoot; the weak will die no less than the strong,
and even these riders, save one. It is for him, for his terrible
renown, that the ages have suffered and groaned. I see him
looming on the horizon, already I detect our whimpers, I
even hear our screams. And the night that will descend upon
our bones will not bring peace, as it did to the Psalmist, but
fear. Judging by the tyrants it has produced, our epoch will
have been anything but mediocre. To find their like, one
42 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
must go back to the Roman Empire or to the Mongol in­
vasions. Even more than Stalin, it is Hitler who deserves
the credit of having set our century's tone. He is important
not so much in himself as in what he heralds, the rough
draft of our future, harbinger of a grim advent and of a
cosmic hysteria, precursor of that grand-scale despot who
will succeed in unifying the world by science, destined not
to deliver but to enslave us. This was understood long ago,
it will be understood again one day. We are born to exist,
not to know; to be, not to assert ourselves. Knowledge,
having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power, will
lead us inexorably to our ruin. It is Genesis, not our dreams
and our systems, that has perceived our condition.
What we have learned by ourselves, whatever knowledge
we have extracted from our own core, must be expiated by
a further disequilibrium: fruit of an intimate chaos, of a
specific or diffuse disease, of a disorder at the root of our
existence, knowledge taints the economy of a human being.
Each of us must pay for the slightest damage he inflicts upon
a universe created for indifference and stagnation; sooner
or later, he will regret not having left it intact. If this is true
of knowledge, it is even truer of ambition, for to despoil
others involves more serious and more immediate conse­
quences than to despoil mystery, or simply matter. You
begin by making others tremble, but others end by trans­
mitting their terrors to you. This is why tyrants, too, live in
fear. The fear our future master will know will doubtless
be heightened by an ominous and unexampled felicity, ap­
propriate to a solitary par excellence lording it over all hu­
manity like a god enthroned in dread, in omnipotent panic
without beginning or end, coupling the acrimony of a Pro­
metheus with the impertinence of a Jehovah, a scandal for
Learning from the Tyrants 43
the imagination and the mind, a provocation to mythology
and theology alike.
Once monsters have been billeted in a city, a kingdom,
or an empire, it is natural that more powerful ones should
appear, under cover of disaster, the liquidation of nations
and of our liberties. A context in which we achieve the
contrary of our aspirations, in which we disfigure them un­
ceasingly, History is certainly not of an angelic essence.
Upon considering it closely, we conceive only one desire:
to promote spleen to the dignity of a gnosis.
All men are more or less envious; politicians, envious
absolutely. A man becomes one of these only to the degree
that he endures no one beside or above himself. To venture
upon an undertaking of any kind, even the most insignifi­
cant, is to sacrifice to envy, supreme prerogative of the
living, law and resource of actions. When envy leaves you,
you are no more than an insect, a nothing, a shadow. And
a sick man . And if envy should sustain you, it assuages the
failures of pride, ministers to your interests, conquers ap­
athy, and performs more than one miracle. Is it not strange
that no therapeutics, no ethics have recommended its ben­
efits, whereas, more charitable than providence, envy pre­
cedes our steps in order to direct them? Woe to the man
who ignores, who neglects, or who shuns envy! Thereby he
shuns the consequences of original sin, the need to act, to
create, and to destroy. Incapable of envying others, what
would he seek among them? A derelict's destiny awaits him.
To be saved, he must be forced to model himself upon the
tyrants, to take advantage of their excesses and their mis­
deeds. It is from them, and not from the sages, that he will
learn how to enjoy things once more, how to live, how to
live down. Let him trace his way back toward sin, let him
44 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
reintegrate the Fall, if he too would share the general deg­
radation, that euphoria of damnation in which all creatures
are immersed. Will he then succeed? Nothing is less certain,
for what he imitates of the tyrants is only their solitude. Pity
him, then, pity a wretch who, not deigning to entertain his
vices or to compete with others, falls short of himself and
remains beneath all others.
If actions are fruits of envy, it will be understood why
political struggle, in its ultimate expression, comes down to
calculations and intrigues likely to assure the elimination of
our rivals or our enemies. If you would strike home, begin
by liquidating those who think according to your categories
and your prejudices and, having traveled the same roads
beside you, necessarily dream of supplanting or felling you.
They are the most dangerous of your competitors; confine
yourself to them, the others can wait. Were I to seize power,
my first concern would be to do away with all my friends.
Any other way of going about it would spoil the metier,
would discredit tyranny. Hitler, quite competent in this in­
stance, displayed great wisdom by getting rid of Roehm, the
only man he addressed in the second person singular, and
of a good number of his early companions. Stalin, for his
part, was no less equal to the task, as the Moscow purges
testify.
As long as a conqueror succeeds, as long as he gains
ground, he can permit himself any atrocity; public opinion
absolves him; once fortune abandons him, the slightest error
turns against him. Everything depends on the moment when
he kills: crime in full glory consolidates authority by the
sacred fear it inspires. The art of making oneself feared and
respected is equivalent to the sense of opportunity. Mus­
solini, the very type of the clumsy or unlucky despot, turned
Learning from the Tyrants 45
cruel when his failure was manifest and his prestige tar­
nished; a few months of inopportune vengeances voided the
work of twenty years. Napoleon was much more perspi­
cacious: had he had the Duke d'Enghien put to death later,
after the Russian campaign for example, he would have
bequeathed an image of himself as an executioner; instead,
this murder now appears as a blot on his memory and noth­
ing more.
If, at the limit, you can rule without crimes, you cannot
do so without injustices. What counts is to determine the
proper proportion of the former and the latter, and to com­
mit both only by fits and starts. For them to be forgiven,
they must appear to be the consequences of rage or madness,
and the tyrant must give the impression of being blood­
thirsty by inadvertence, pursuing hideous schemes under
the mildest appearance. Absolute power is not a comfortable
matter: only ham actors and assassins on a grand scale dis­
tinguish themselves in its possession. There is nothing more
admirable humanly, and more lamentable historically, than
a tyrant demoralized by his scruples.
"And the people?" it will be asked. The thinker or the
historian who employs the word without irony disqualifies
himself. It is all too clear what "the people" are destined
for: to suffer events and rulers' whims, lending themselves
to the schemes that weaken and overwhelm them. Every
political experiment, however "advanced," is performed at
the people's expense, is carried out against the people: the
people bear the stigmata of slavery by divine or diabolic
decree. No use wasting your pity: the people's cause admits
of no recourse. Nations and empires are formed by the
people's indulgence of iniquities of which they are the ob­
ject. No head of state, no conqueror fails to scorn the peo-
46 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
ple; but the people accept this scorn and live on it. Were
they to cease being weak or victimized, were they to dis­
appoint their destiny, society would collapse and with it
history itself. Let us not be overoptimistic: nothing in the
people permits us to envision such a splendid eventuality.
As they are, the people represent an invitation to despotism.
The people endure their ordeals, sometimes solicit them,
and rebel against them only to rush into new ones, more
horrible than the old. Revolution being their one luxury,
they fling themselves into it, not so much to derive certain
benefits from it or to improve their lot, as to acquire for
themselves, too, the right to insolence, an advantage which
consoles them for their habitual setbacks, but which they
immediately lose once the privileges of chaos are abolished.
Since no regime assures their salvation, the people adapt
themselves to all and to none. And from the Flood to the
Last Judgment, all they can claim is to fulfill their mission
honestly: to be vanquished.
To return to our friends, beyond the reason invoked to
get rid of them, there exists another: they know our limits
and our defects too well (friendship comes down to this and
nothing more) to entertain the slightest illusion as to our
virtues. Hostile, moreover, to our promotion to the rank
of idol (to which public opinion would be quite disposed),
determined to safeguard our mediocrity, our real dimen­
sions, they puncture the myth we would like to create in
our behalf, they keep us at our exact measure, denounce
the false image we have of ourselves. And when they grant
us a little praise, they insinuate into it so many dark hints
and subtleties that their flattery, by dint of circumspection,
is equivalent to an affront. What they secretly long for is
our collapse, our humiliation, and our ruin. Identifying our
Learning from the Tyrants 47
success with a usurpation, they keep all their perspicacity
for the scrutiny of our thoughts and our actions in order to
expose their vanity, and show kindness only when we our­
selves give evidence of decline. So lively is their enthusiasm
for the spectacle of our downfall that they really love us at
such times, sympathize with our miseries, avoid their own
in order to partake of ours and feast on them. During our
elevation, they observed us pitilessly, they were objective;
but now they can permit themselves the elegance of seeing
us as more than we are and of pardoning our former suc­
cesses, being convinced that we will enjoy no new ones.
And such is their penchant for us that they spend their best
hours pitying our deformities and gushing over our defects.
Caesar's great mistake was not to distrust his own people,
those who, observing him at close hand, could not warrant
his claim to divine lineage; they refused to deify him; the
mob consented to this, but the mob consents to everything.
Had he done away with his friends, Caesar, instead of an
ignoble death, would have enjoyed a prolonged apotheosis,
the superb deliquescence suited to a real god. For all his
sagacity, he had a certain naivete-he did not realize that
our intimates are the worst enemies of our statue.
In a republic, that paradise of debility, the politician is a
petty tyrant who obeys the laws; but a strong personality
does not respect them, or rather respects only those he
creates. Expert in the unjustifiable, such a personality re­
gards the ultimatum as the acme and honor of his career.
To be in a position to issue one, or several, certainly involves
the kind of pleasure in comparison to which the rest are
merely sham. I do not believe you can lay claim to the
command of affairs if you do not aspire to this unparalleled
provocation, the most insolent of all, even more execrable
48 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
than the aggression by which it is generally followed. "Of
how many ultimatums is he guilty?" should be the question
asked about a head of state. Is there none on his record?
History disdains him, history which wakes up only in the
horror chapters and is somnolent in those of tolerance, of
liberalism, regimes in which temperaments wilt and in which
the most virulent seem, at best, watered-down conspirators.
I pity those who have never conceived a dream of ex­
cessive domination, nor felt the times seething within them­
selves. In the days when Ahriman was my principle and my
god, when I thirsted for barbarism, I brooded over the
cavalcades within myself, hordes provoking one sweet ca­
tastrophe after the next! Foundered as I have, nowadays, in
modesty, I nonetheless harbor a weakness for tyrants, whom
I always prefer to redeemers and prophets; I prefer them
because they do not take refuge in formulas; because their
prestige is an equivocal one, their cravings self-destructive;
whereas the others, possessed of a limitless ambition, dis­
guise its aims under deceptive precepts, retreat from the
citizen in order to rule over conscience, to occupy it, and,
once implanted there, to create permanent ravages without
incurring the reproach, however merited, of indiscretion or
sadism. Compared to the power of a Buddha, a Jesus, or a
Mohammed, what does that of the conquerors signify?
Abandon the notion of glory unless you are tempted to
found a religion! Though in this sector, most places are
taken, ·and men do not resign them readily: the leaders of
a sect, what are they if not founders of a religion to the
second degree? From the point of view of effectiveness
alone, a Calvin or a Luther, having launched conflicts still
unresolved today, quite eclipses a Charles V or a Philip II.
Spiritual Caesarism is more refined and richer in upheavals
Learning from the Tyrants 49
than Caesarism proper: if you would leave a name, attach
it to a church rather than to an empire. You will thereby
have neophytes enfeoffed to your fate or to your fads, fol­
lowers you can save or mistreat as you like.
The leaders of a sect stop at nothing, for their very scru­
ples constitute part of their tactics. But setting aside the
sects, an extreme case, the mere desire to institute a religious
order is worth more, in terms of ambition, than to rule a
city or to conquer by force of arms. To insinuate yourself
into men's minds, to become master of their secrets, to
despoil them, in a sense, of themselves, of their uniqueness,
to rob them even of the privilege, regarded as inviolable,
of "conscience," what tyrant, what conqueror has aimed so
high? Invariably the religious strategy will be subtler, and
more suspect, than the political. Merely compare Loyola's
Spiritual Exercises, so shrewd in their detached tone, with
the barefaced policies of The Prince, and you will measure
the distance separating the cunning of the confessional from
that of a chancellery or a throne.
The more intense a spiritual leader's appetite for power,
the more he is concerned-not without reason-to limit it
in others. Who among us, left to himself, would not take
up space, air itself, and regard himself as its owner? A society
that seeks to be perfect should make the straitjacket fash­
ionable or else obligatory. For man moves only to do evil.
Religions, striving to cure him of his obsession with power
and to give a nonpolitical direction to his aspirations, join
the regimes of authority, since like them, though with other
methods, they seek to dominate man, to humble his nature,
his native megalomania. What consolidated their credit, what
enabled them to triumph hitherto over our inclinations-I
mean the ascetic element-is precisely what has ceased to
50 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
gain a hold over us. A perilous liberation was to result;
ungovernable in every sense, fully emancipated, released
from our chains and our superstitions, we are ripe for the
remedies of terror. He who aspires to total freedom achieves
it only to return to his point of departure, to his initial
servitude. Whence the vulnerability of developed societies,
amorphous masses with neither idols nor ideals, dangerously
lacking in fanaticism, devoid of organic links and so helpless
amid their whims or their convulsions that they anticipate­
and this is the sole dream of which they are still capable­
the security and dogmas of the yoke. Unfit to assume any
longer the responsibility for their destiny, they scheme, even
more than primitive societies, for the advent of despotism,
to be delivered from the last vestiges of an exhausted, drained,
and futilely obsessive appetite for power.
A world without tyrants would be as boring as a zoo
without hyenas. The master we await in terror will be pre­
cisely a connoisseur of corruption, in whose presence we
shall all figure as carrion. Let him come, let him sniff us out,
let him wallow in our exhalations! Already, a new odor hangs
over the universe.
In order not to yield to political temptation, we must keep
a close watch over ourselves at every moment. How to
manage this, especially in a democratic regime, whose es­
sential vice is to permit anyone at all to seek power and to
give free rein to his ambitions? There results a pullulation
of braggarts, of futureless quibblers, commonplace lunatics
whom fatality refuses to sign, incapable of any true frenzy,
inept at both triumph and collapse. Yet it is their very nullity
that permits and secures our liberties, threatened as they
are by exceptional personalities. A self-respecting republic
Learning from the Tyrants 51
should fall into a panic upon the appearance of a great man,
should banish him from its midst, or at least forbid a legend
to grow up around him. If a republic is reluctant to do such
things, it is because, dazzled by its scourge, it no longer
believes in its institutions or in its reasons for being. It is
entangled in its laws, and these, which protect its enemy,
dispose and commit the republic to failure. Succumbing to
the excesses of its own tolerance, it spares the adversary
that will not spare it in turn, authorizes the myths that erode
and destroy it, letting itself be trapped in the suavities of
its own executioner. Does a republic deserve to subsist when
its very principles invite it to disappear? Tragic paradox of
freedom: the mediocre men who alone make its exercise
possible cannot guarantee its duration. We owe everything
to their insignificance, and we lose everything by it. Thus
they are always unequal to their task. It is this mediocrity
that I hated in the days when I unreservedly loved the
tyrants, of whom we can never say often enough that unlike
their caricature (every democrat is an operetta tyrant), they
have a destiny, even too much of one. And if I made them
into a sort of cult, it was because, having the instinct of
command, they do not lower themselves to dialogue or to
arguments: they give orders, issue decrees, without con­
descending to justify their actions; whence their cynicism,
which I set above all virtues and all vices, the sign of su­
periority, even of nobility, which, in my eyes, separated
them from the rest of mortal men. Unable to render myself
worthy of them by action, I hoped to do so by words, by
the practice of sophism and enormity: to be as odious with
the means of mind as they were with those of power, to
devastate by language, to blow up the word and with it the
world, to explode with one and the other, and finally to
52 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
collapse under their debris! Now, deceived by these ex­
travagances, by all that once enlivened my days, I have come
to dream of a city, a marvel of moderation, ruled by a team
of slightly senile octogenarians, involuntarily amenable yet
still lucid enough to make good use of their decrepitudes,
exempt from desires, from regrets, from doubts, and so
concerned with the general equilibrium and the public wel­
fare that they would regard even a smile as a sign of prof­
ligacy and of subversion. And such is at present my fallen
state that democrats themselves seem to me too ambitious,
too mad. I should still be their accomplice if their hatred
of tyranny were pure; but they abominate it only because
it relegates them to private life and confronts them with
their nothingness. The only order of greatness to which they
can attain is that of failure. Liquidation suits them well, they
are comfortable in it, and when they excel there, they de­
serve our respect. As a general rule, in order to lead a state
to ruin, there must be a certain ardor, particular tendencies,
even talents. But it may happen that circumstances are pro­
pitious; the task is then easy, as is proved by the example
of countries in decline, lacking inner resources, that fall prey
to the insoluble, to lacerations, to the play of contradictory
opinions and tendencies. Such was the case of ancient Greece.
With respect to failure, that of Greece was perfect: one
might say that she worked at it in order to offer it as a model
and to discourage posterity from making similar attempts.
Starting from the third century B.C., her substance wasted,
her idols wavering, her political life torn between the Mac­
edonian party and the Roman, Greece resorted-in order
to solve her crises, to remedy the curse of her liberties­
to foreign domination, and for over five hundred years ac­
cepted Rome's yoke, impelled to do so by the very degree
Learning from the Tyrants 53
of refinement and gangrene to which she had attained. Once
polytheism was reduced to a heap of fables, she would lose
her religious and with it her political genius, two realities
indissolubly linked: to call in question the gods is to call in
question the city over which they preside. Greece could not
survive them, any more than Rome would survive hers. That
Greece lost, with her religious instinct, her political instinct,
we are easily enough convinced by regarding her reactions
during the civil war: always on the wrong side, joining Pom­
pey against Caesar, Brutus against Octavius and Antony,
Antony against Octavius, Greece regularly espoused mis­
fortune, as if she had found in the continuity of fiasco a
guarantee of stability, the solace and convenience of the
irreparable. The more the evolved nations weary of their
gods (and the gods themselves weary of them), the more
readily they risk succumbing. The citizen is refined at the
expense of institutions; no longer believing in them, he can
no longer defend them. When the Romans, by contact with
the Greeks, finally lost their vulgarity, that is, weakened,
the days of the republic were numbered. The Romans re­
signed themselves to dictatorship, perhaps longed for it in
secret: no Rubicon without the complicities of a collective
fatigue.
The death principle inherent in all regimes is more per­
ceptible in republics than in dictatorships: the former pro­
claim and parade it, the latter disguise and deny it.
Nonetheless, despotisms, thanks to their methods, can en­
sure a longer and above all a more comfortable duration: they
solicit, they cultivate events, while the others gladly forgo
them, freedom being a state of absence, absence likely
to . . . d egenerate when citizens exhausted by the burden of
being themselves aspire to nothing more than humiliation
54 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
and defeat, thereby satisfying their nostalgia for servitude.
Nothing more distressing than the exhaustion and the rout
of a republic: it should be described in the tonality of elegy
or epigram, or better still, in that of Montesquieu's Spirit
of the Laws: "When Sulla sought to restore Rome her liberty,
she could no longer receive it; she retained but a faint vestige
of virtue; and, since she had continually less of this, instead
of waking after Caesar, Tiberius, Caius, Claudius, Nero,
Domitian, she was ever more enslaved: each blow fell upon
the tyrant, none upon tyranny." This is so because tyranny
is just what one can develop a taste for, since it so happens
that man prefers to wallow in fear rather than to face the
anguish of being himself. Generalize the phenomenon and
the Caesars appear: how to blame them, when they answer
the requirements of our misery and the pleas of our cow­
ardice? They even deserve to be admired: they fling them­
selves upon assassination, constantly brood upon it, accept
its horrors and its ignominy, and devote all their thoughts
to it, to the point of forgetting suicide and exile, less spec­
tacular formulas though gender and more agreeable. Having
opted for the most difficult, they can flourish only in un­
certain times, sustaining chaos or else throttling it. The epoch
favorable to their advance coincides with the end of a cycle
of civilization. This is obvious with regard to the ancient
world, and it will be no less so with regard to ours, which
is heading straight for a much more considerable tyranny
than the one rampant in the first centuries of our era. The
most elementary meditation on the historical process of
which we are the result reveals that Caesarism will be the
mode by which the sacrifice of our liberties will be consum­
mated. If the continents are to be welded together, unified,
it is force that will do the job, not persuasion; like the Roman
Learning from the Tyrants 55
Empire, the one to come will be forged by the sword and
will be established with our unanimous collaboration, since
our very terrors demand it.
If you accuse me of extravagance, I answer that it is indeed
possible that I am anticipating somewhat hastily. The dates
are of no importance. The first Christians expected the world
to end from one minute to the next; they were off by merely
a few thousand years . . . . In an entirely different order of
expectation, I too may be mistaken; but finally, one neither
tests nor proves a vision: mine of the coming tyranny strikes
me as so decisively apparent that it seems unworthy to at­
tempt to demonstrate its well-foundedness. It is a certitude
that partakes of both the shudder and the axiom. To it I
adhere with the passion of a convulsionary and the assurance
of a geometrician. No, I am not extravagant, or mistaken.
And I could not even say, with Keats, that the sentiment
of shadows invades me. Rather it is a light that assails me,
precise and intolerable, by which I envisage not the end of
the world-that would be extravagant-but the end of a
style of civilization and of a way of writing. To confine myself
to what is at hand, and more particularly to Europe, it seems
to me, with a final distinctness, that unity will not be formed,
as some may suppose, by agreement and deliberation, but
by violence, according to the laws that govern the construc­
tion of empires. For these old nations, steeped in their pro­
vincial obsessions, to renounce and be released from them
will require a hand of iron, for they will never consent to
such a thing of their own accord. Once enslaved, communing
within humiliation and defeat, they can devote themselves
to a supranational enterprise, under the vigilant and scornful
eye of their new master. Their servitude will be brilliant,
they will nurse it with eagerness and delicacy, lavishing in-
56 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
deed the last remains of their genius upon it. They will pay
dearly for the luster of their slavery.
Thus Europe, ahead of time, will set, as always, an ex­
ample to the world and win renown in her role as protagonist
and as victim. Her mission consisted in prefiguring the or­
deals of others, in suffering for them and before them, in
offering them her own convulsions as a model, so that they
would be dispensed from inventing original, personal ones.
The more Europe exerted herself for them, the more she
tormented herself in her struggles, the better they lived as
parasites upon her pangs, as heirs of her revolutions. In the
future too, they will turn to her, till the day when, spent,
she can no longer bequeath them anything but her leavings.
Odyssey of Rancor
We spend the prime of our sleepless nights in mentally
mangling our enemies, rending their entrails, wringing their
veins, trampling each organ to mush, and charitably leaving
them the skeleton to enjoy. Whereupon we forbear, over­
come by fatigue, and drop off to sleep. A well-earned rest
after so much scruple, so much zeal. Moreover we must
recover our strength in order to begin all over again the
next night-resuming a labor that would discourage the
most Herculean butcher. No doubt about it: having enemies
is no sinecure.
The program of our nights would be less crowded if by
day we could give our resentment free rein. To achieve not
even happiness, merely equilibrium, we need to liquidate a
good number of our kind, to inflict a regular hecatomb in
the fashion of our remote and relaxed ancestors. Not so
relaxed, it will be objected-the caveman's demographic
poverty denying him any continuous opportunity for slaugh­
ter. So be it! But he had compensations, he was better
provided for than we are: rushing off to hunt at all hours,
falling upon wild beasts, it was still his own species he was
destroying. Blood-baptized, he could readily indulge his
frenzy; no need for him to disguise and defer his sanguinary
57
58 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
intentions, whereas we are doomed to review and repress
our lust for rapine till it shrivels within us-reduced to
curbing, to postponing, even to renouncing our revenge.
To forswear vengeance is to chain oneself to forgiveness,
to founder in pardon, to be tainted by the hatred smothered
within . . . . S pared, our enemy obsesses and aggrieves us,
especially when we have resolved to abhor him no longer.
Indeed we truly forgive him only if we have promoted or
witnessed his fall, if he affords us the spectacle of an ig­
nominious end or-supreme reconciliation!-if we contem­
plate his corpse. Such happiness, in truth, is rare and not
to be relied on. For our enemy is never felled: always erect,
always triumphant, it is his nature to loom up before us,
flouting our timid gibes by his full-blown scorn.
Nothing is more deleterious to happiness than the "duty"
to resist our primal depths, to turn a deaf ear to the call of
the wild. The result? Those torments of a civilized man
reduced to smiling, harnessed to calumny, and disconsolate
at having to kill without making a move-by the mere power
of the Word, that invisible dagger. Various are the ways of
cruelty. Supplanting the jungle, conversation permits our
bestiality to function without immediate damage to our kind.
If, by the whim of some malefic power, we should lose the
use of speech, no one would survive unscathed. The need
to kill, inscribed in every cell, we have managed to transfer
to our thoughts: only this feat accounts for the possibility,
and the permanence, of society. May we conclude that we
have won out over our native corruption, our homicidal
talents? That would be to miscalculate the Word's capacities
and to exaggerate its powers. The cruelty which we have
inherited, which we wield, is not to be so readily ruled; as
long as we do not capitulate to it altogether, as long as we
Odyssey of Rancor 59
have not used it up, we preserve it in our secret self-we
are never released from it. Your real murderer premeditates
his deed, plans it out, performs it, and by doing so frees
himself, for a time, from his impulses; on the other hand,
the man who does not kill because he cannot, though he
endures the craving to do so-the unrealized assassin, let
us say, the elegiac trifler of carnage-mentally commits
countless crimes, and suffers far worse for them, since he
drags with him the regret for all the abominations he cannot
perpetrate. In the same way, the man who shrinks from
revenge poisons his days, curses both his scruples and that
act against nature, pardon. Doubtless, revenge is not always
sweet: once it is consummated, we feel inferior to our victim,
or else we are tangled in the subtleties of remorse; so ven­
geance too has its venom, though it comes closer to what we
are, to what we feel, to the very law of the self; it is also
healthier than magnanimity. The Furies were held to ante­
date the gods, Zeus included. Vengeance before Divinity!
This is the major intuition of ancient mythology.
Those who, whether from impotence, lack of opportu­
nity, or grandstand generosity, have not reacted to their
enemies' wiles, bear upon their faces the stigmata of re­
pressed rage, the traces of affront and opprobrium, the dis­
honor of having forgiven. The blows they have not dealt
are turned against themselves and collaborate, within their
features, to illustrate their cowardice. Bewildered and ob­
sessed, cornered by shame, saturated with bitterness, re­
fractory to others as to themselves, as stifled as they are
ready to explode, they seem to be making a superhuman
effort to ward off a risk of convulsion. The greater their
impatience, the more they must disguise it, and when they
cannot, they give way at last, but to no purpose, stupidly,
60 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
for it is in absurdity that they founder, like those who, having
accumulated too much bile and too much silence, at the
crucial moment lose all their powers before their enemies,
of whom they show themselves to be unworthy. Their fail­
ure will further enhance their spite, and each experience,
however trifling, will signify for them a further dose of gall.
We become good-natured, we become good only by de­
stroying the best of our nature, only by submitting our body
to the discipline of anemia and our mind to that of oblivion.
As long as we preserve even a trace of memory, forgiveness
comes down to a struggle with our instincts, an aggression
against our own ego. It is our flagrancies that keep us in
tune with ourselves, ensure our continuity, link us to our
past, stimulate our powers of evocation; in the same way,
our imaginations function only in hope of others' misfor­
tune, in the raptures of disgust, in that disposition which
impels us if not to commit infamies, at least to contemplate
them. How could it be otherwise on a planet where flesh
propagates with the shamelessness of a scourge? Wherever
we go, we come up against the human, a repulsive ubiquity
before which we fall into stupor and revolt, a perplexity on
fire. Once, when space was less crowded, less infested by
mankind, certain sects, indubitably inspired by a beneficent
power, advocated and practiced castration; by an infernal
paradox, they have been suppressed just when their doctrine
would have been more opportune and more salutary than
ever before. Maniacs of procreation, bipeds with devalued
faces, we have lost all appeal for each other. And it is only
on a half-deserted earth, peopled at most by a few thousand
inhabitants, that our physiognomies might recover their an­
cient glamour. The multiplication of our kind borders on
the obscene; the duty to love them, on the preposterous.
Odyssey of Rancor 61
Which does not keep our thoughts from being contaminated
by the presence of the human, from stinking of the human,
and from being unable to cleanse themselves of it. Of what
truths are we capable, to what revelation can we rise, when
this pestilence asphyxiates the mind and disqualifies it from
considering anything but the pernicious and fetid animal
whose emanations it endures? He who is too weak to declare
war on mankind must never forget, in his moments of fervor,
to pray for a second Flood, more radical than the first.
Knowledge subverts love: in proportion as we penetrate
our own secrets, we come to loathe our kind, precisdy
because they resemble us. When we have no further illu­
sions about ourselves, we retain none about others; the
unspeakable that we discover by introspection we extend,
by a legitimate generalization, to other mortals; depraved
in their essence, we rightly endow them with all the vices
which, oddly enough, most of us turn out to be unfit for or
averse to ferreting out, to observing in ourselves or in oth­
ers. How easy it is to do evil: everyone manages; but to
assume it explicitly, to acknowledge its inexorable reality, is
an unwonted feat. In practice, anyone can compete with the
devil; in theory, this is not the case. To commit horrors and
to conceive ho"or are two irreducible actions: no common
ground between the experience of cynicism and cynicism
in the abstract. Let us beware of those who subscribe to a
reassuring philosophy, who believe in the Good and will­
ingly erect it into an idol; they could not have done so if,
honestly peering into themselves, they had sounded their
depths or their miasmas; but those-rare, it is true-who
have been indiscreet or unfortunate enough to plunge all
the way down to the bottom of their beings, they know how
to judge man: they can no longer love him, for they no
62 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
longer love themselves, though remaining-and this will be
their punishment-nailed even faster to themselves than
before . . . .
In order to keep the faith, our own and others', in order
to lose sight of the illusory character, the nullity of all action,
nature has made us opaque to ourselves, subject to a blind­
ness which generates and rules the world. Were we to un­
dertake an exhaustive self-scrutiny, disgust would paralyze
us, we would be doomed to a thankless existence. The in­
compatibility between action and self-knowledge seems to
have escaped Socrates; otherwise, in his capacity as peda­
gogue, as man's ally, would he have dared adopt the oracle's
motto, with all the abysses of renunciation it implies?
As long as we possess a will of our own, and as long as
we are bound to it (this is what Lucifer has been blamed
for), revenge is an imperative, an organic necessity which
defines the universe of diversity, of the "self," and which
can have no meaning in the universe of identity. If it were
true that "we breathe in the One" (Plotinus), on whom
would we take revenge where every difference is blurred,
where we commune in the indiscernible and lose our con­
tours there? As a matter of fact, we breathe in the multiple;
our kingdom is that of the "I," and through the "I" there is
no salvation. To exist is to condescend to sensation, hence
to self-affirmation; whence not-knowing (with its direct con­
sequence: revenge), the principle of phantasmagoria, source
of our peregrination on earth. The more we try to wrest
ourselves from our ego, the deeper we sink into it. Try as
we will to explode it, just when we suppose we have suc­
ceeded, there it is, apparently more self-assured than ever;
whatever we do to destroy it merely augments its strength
and solidity, and such is its vigor and its perversity that it
Odyssey of Rancor 63
flourishes still more in affliction than in joy. As with the
ego, so a fortiori with actions. When we imagine ourselves
liberated from them, we are anchored in them more fixedly
than ever: even when corrupted into simulacra, actions pre­
vail over us, subject us to themselves. Whether an enterprise
is undertaken reluctantly or by persuasion, we always end
by adhering to it, becoming its slaves or its dupes. No man
stirs without allying himself to the multiple, to appearances,
to the "I." To act is to forfeit the absolute.
Action's sovereignty comes, let us admit it straight off,
from our vices, which master a greater contingent of exis­
tence than our virtues possess. If we espouse the cause of
life and more particularly that of history, they seem useful
to the supreme degree: is it not thanks to our vices that we
cling to things, and that we cut something of a figure here
on earth? Inseparable from our condition, vices are ubiq­
uitous: only the puppet is without them. To try to boycott
them is to conspire against ourselves, to lay down our arms
in the midst of battle, to discredit ourselves in our neighbor's
eyes or to remain forever void. The miser deserves to be
envied not for his money but precisely for his avarice, his
real treasure. By attaching the individual to a sector of real­
ity, implanting him there, vices, which do nothing lightly,
occupy him, intensify him, justify his alienation from the
vague. The practical value of manias, of derangements and
aberrations, is irrefutable: insofar as we limit ourselves to
this world, to the here and now where our desires confront
one another, where competitiveness is rampant, even a minor
vice is more effective than a major virtue. The political di­
mension of beings (taking the political as the fulfillment of
the biological) safeguards the realm of actions, the realm of
dynamic abjection. To know ourselves is to identify the
64 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
sordid motive of our gestures, the inadmissible that is in­
scribed within our substance, the totality of patent or clan­
destine miseries on which our welfare depends. Whatever
emanates from the inferior zones of our nature is invested
with strength, whatever comes from below stimulates: we
invariably produce and perform better out of jealousy and
greed than out of nobility and disinterestedness. Sterility
awaits those who do not deign to encourage or divulge their
flaws. Whatever the domain to which we owe allegiance, in
order to excel there we must cultivate the insatiable aspect
of our character, must urge our inclinations to fanaticism,
to intolerance, to vindictiveness. Nothing is more suspect
than fruitfulness. If purity is what you seek, if you aspire
to some inner transparency, make haste to abdicate your
talents, abandon the realm of actions, exile yourself from
the human, renounce-to use the pious jargon-the "con­
versation of creatures."
Great gifts, far from excluding great defects, actually stip­
ulate and reinforce them. When the saints accuse themselves
of this or that sin, we must take them at their word. The
very interest they take in others' suffering testifies against
them. Their pity, pity in general-what is pity but the vice
of kindness? Deriving its effectiveness from the wicked
principle it conceals, pity delights in others' ordeals, pos­
tulates hell as a promised land it cannot do without, and if
it is not destructive in and of itself, nonetheless profits by
all that destroys. Extreme aberration of kindness, pity ends
up as its own negation, in the saints even more than among
ourselves. To be convinced of this, merely frequent their
lives and contemplate the voracity with which they fling
themselves upon our sins, their nostalgia for illustrious dis­
grace or interminable remorse, their exasperation before
Odyssey of Rancor 65
the mediocrity of our misdeeds and their regret at not having
to torment themselves more deeply for our redemption.
High as one mounts, one remains a captive of one's na­
ture, of one's original debacle. Men of great ambitions, or
simply of talents, are monsters, superb and hideous mon­
sters who seem to be plotting some terrible crime; and in
truth, they are preparing their work . . . c reating it in secret,
like criminals: must they not crush all those who would take
the same path as themselves? A man strives and creates only
to crush beings or Being, rivals or the Rival. At every level,
minds war upon each other, delight and wallow in defiance:
the saints themselves envy and exclude one another-like
the gods, moreover: witness those perpetual scuffles which
are the scourge of every Olympus. Anyone approaching the
same domain or the same problem as ourselves jeopardizes
our originality, our privileges, the integrity of our existence,
strips us of our chimeras and our chances. The task of casting
him down, of defeating or at least disparaging him assumes
the form of a mission, even of a fatality. We are satisfied
only by someone who abstains, who in no way manifests
himself, yet he must also not accede to the rank of model:
the acknowledged sage excites and legitimates our envy. Even
an idler, if he distinguishes himself in his sloth, if he shines
there, risks being reviled: he attracts too much attention to
himself. . . . T he ideal would be a well-proportioned efface­
ment. No one has managed that.
We acquire glory only to the detriment of others, of those
who seek it too, and there is no reputation that is not won
at the cost of countless abuses. The man who has emerged
from anonymity, or who merely strives to do so, proves that
he has eliminated every scruple from his life, that he has
triumphed over his conscience, if by some chance he ever
66 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
had such a thing. To renounce one's name is to be doomed
to inactivity; to cling to it is to degrade oneself. Must we
either pray or write prayers? exist or express ourselves? One
thing is sure: the principle of expansion, immanent in our
nature, makes us regard others' merits as an encroachment
upon our own, a continual provocation. If glory is forbidden,
or inaccessible, we blame those who have attained it: they
could have done so, we believe, only by keeping us from
it; it was ours by right, belonged to us, and without the
machinations of these usurpers, it would have been ours.
"Much more than property, it is glory which is theft"­
motto of the embittered and, to a degree, of us all. The
delights of being unknown or misunderstood are rare; yet
upon consideration, are they not equivalent to the pride of
having triumphed over honors and vanities? to the desire
for an unwonted renown, for fame without a public? Which
is certainly the supreme form, the summum of the appetite
for glory.
Nor is the word too strong: it is indeed an appetite which
thrusts its roots into our senses and which answers to a
physiological necessity, to a cry of our vitals. In order to
forsake it, in order to conquer it, we should have to meditate
upon our insignificance, assent to it fully yet derive no plea­
sure from doing so, for our certainty of being nothing leads,
if we are not careful, to complacency and pride: we do not
perceive our own nothingness, or linger over it for long,
without clinging to it . . . s ensually. A certain happiness en­
ters into our lust to denounce the fragility of happiness; and
in the same way, when we profess to scorn glory we are far
from being unfamiliar with the thirst for it, we sacrifice to
glory just when we proclaim its inanity. A loathsome desire,
certainly, but inherent in our organization; in order to ex-
Odyssey of Rancor 67
tirpate it, we must condemn flesh and spirit alike to petri­
faction, must compete with the mineral kingdom in unconcern,
then forget the others, evacuate them from our conscious­
ness, for the mere fact of their presence, radiant and fulfilled,
wakens our evil genius who commands us to sweep them
away and to forsake our obscurity in order to eclipse their
brilliance.
We resent everyone who has "chosen" to live in the same
epoch as ourselves, those who run at our side, who hamper
our stride or leave us behind. In clearer terms: all contem­
poraries are odious. We resign ourselves to the superiority
of a dead man, never to that of the living, whose very ex­
istence constitutes a reproach and a censure, an invitation
to the intoxications of modesty. That so many of our kind
surpass us is as obvious as it is intolerable, and to be evaded
by arrogating to ourselves the advantage of being unique.
We gasp for breath among our competitors or our models:
what a comfort to be among their tombs! The disciple him­
self breathes freely and enjoys his freedom only upon the
master's death. All of us, insofar as we exist, pray for the
downfall of those who eclipse us by their gifts, their labors,
or their feats, and with greed, feverish greed, we await their
last moments. Suppose this one climbs, in our own realm,
above us; reason enough for us to want to be rid of him:
how to forgive him the admiration he inspires, the secret
and vexatious worship we shower upon him? Let him be
gone, let him fade away, let him be done with, in fact, be
dead, if we are to revere him without laceration, without
acrimony, if our martyrdom is to cease!
With any brains at all, instead of thanking us for our
propensity, he would hold it against us, would tax us with
imposture, reject us with disgust or commiseration. Too full
68 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
of himself, with no experience of the calvary of admiration,
or of the contradictory impulses it provokes in us, he never
suspects that by putting him on a pedestal we have consented
to demean ourselves, and that this humiliation will have to
be paid for-by him: could we ever forget what a blow­
unwittingly, we grant him that-he has dealt to the sweet
illusion of our singularity and our value? Having committed
the imprudence, or the abuse, of letting himself be adored
too long, now he must suffer the consequences: by the
decree of our lassitude, he turns from a real god to a false
one, reduced to a regret that he took up so much of our
time. Perhaps we venerated him only in hopes of someday
taking our revenge. If we love to prostrate ourselves, we
love still more to deny those before whom we have groveled.
Every undermining labor exalts, confers energy; whence the
urgency, whence the practical infallibility of vile sentiments.
Envy, which makes a fool into a daredevil, a worm into a
tiger, whips up our nerves, ignites our blood, communicates
to the body a shudder that keeps it from going soft, lends
the most anodyne countenance an expression of concen­
trated ardor; without envy, there would be no events, nor
even a world; indeed it is envy that has made man possible,
permitted him to gain a name for himself, to accede to
greatness by the fall, by that rebellion against the anonymous
glory of paradise, to which-any more than the Fallen Angel,
his inspiration and his model-he could not adapt himself.
Everything that breathes and moves testifies to the initial
taint. Forever associated with the effervescences of Satan
(patron of Time, scarcely distinct from God, being merely
His visible countenance), we are victims of this genius of
sedition who persuades us to perform our task as living men
by rousing us against one another in a deplorable combat,
Odyssey of Rancor 69
no doubt, but a fortifying one: we emerge from torpor,
enlivened whenever-triumphing over our Higher Im­
pulses-we become aware of our role as destroyers.
Admiration, on the contrary, by eroding our substance,
depresses and ultimately demoralizes us; hence we turn against
the admired-anyone guilty of having inflicted upon us the
task of raising ourselves to his level. He must not be sur­
prised if our ascent toward him is followed by backsliding,
or if we sometimes revise our enthusiasms. It is our instinct
for self-preservation that reminds us of our duty to our­
selves, that compels such reassessments. We do not cease
to esteem or to extol someone because his merits are in
question, but because we can enhance ourselves only at his
expense. Without being exhausted, our capacity for admi­
ration suffers a crisis during which, given over to the plea­
sures and paroxysms of apostasy, we enlist our idols in order
to repudiate and smash them one after the other, and this
iconoclastic frenzy, shameful in itself, is nonetheless the
force that vivifies our faculties.
A vulgar, hence effective, goad to inspiration, resentment
triumphs in art, which cannot do without it-any more than
philosophy, moreover: to think is to take a cunning revenge,
in which we camouflage our baseness and conceal our lower
instincts. Judged by what it excludes and rejects, a system
suggests a settling of accounts, skillfully executed. Philos­
ophers, like poets, like everyone who has something to say,
are pitiless. If the gentle and the tepid leave no trace, it is
not for lack of perspicacity or of depth, but of aggression,
which nonetheless implies no integral vitality. At grips with
the world, the thinker is often a weakling, a rachitic runt,
all the more virulent for realizing his own biological infe­
riority and suffering from it. The more he is rejected by
70 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
life, the more he tries to master it, to subjugate it, though
unable to do so. Sufficiently disinherited to pursue happi­
ness, yet too proud to find it or to resign himself to it, at
once real and unreal, formidable and impotent, the thinker
suggests a synthesis of beast and ghost, a madman who lives
by metaphor.
An abiding, vigilant rancor can constitute, all by itself, the
armature of an individual: weakness of character proceeds
in most cases from a poor memory. Not to forget an insult
is one of the secrets of success, an art invariably possessed
by men with strong convictions, for every conviction con­
sists chiefly of hate, and only secondly of love. Perplexities,
on the other hand, are the lot of the man who, equally inept
at hating or loving, has nothing to choose, not even his
lacerations. If he would assert himself, shake off his apathy,
play a part, let him invent enemies and cling to them, let
him waken his dormant cruelty or the memory of outrages
imprudently despised! To take the smallest step forward,
even just to exist, requires a minimum of villainy. Let no
one abandon his holdings in indignity if he wants to "per­
severe in being." Rancor preserves; if, moreover, we can
sustain it, nurture it, we avoid softness and insipidity. We
should even encourage it toward things: what better tactic
for arming ourselves against them, for lowering ourselves
advantageously to reality? A pure sentiment, lacking any
vital charge, is a contradiction in terms, an impossibility, a
fiction. Indeed there is no such thing, even if we sought it
in religion, a realm where it is supposed to flourish. We do
not undertake to exist, still less to pray, without sacrificing
to the devil. In most cases we attach ourselves to God in
order to take revenge on life, to punish it, to signify we can
Odyssey of Rancor 71
do without it, that we have found something better; and we
also attach ourselves to God in horror of men, in reprisal
against them, to make them understand that, having entree
elsewhere, we do not find their society indispensable, and
that if we grovel before Him, it is in order not to have to
grovel before them. Without this shabby, murky, secret
element, our fervor would lack energy-perhaps it could
not even exist.
The unreality of pure sentiments-we might suppose that
it was the sick who could best reveal such a thing to us, that
this was their mission and the meaning of their ordeals.
Nothing more natural, since it is in the sick that the flaws
of our race are concentrated and exacerbated. Having ranged
through the various species, having striven with more or
less success to imprint its sign upon them, Disease, weary
of its progress, doubtless longed for rest and sought some­
one over whom to declare its supremacy in peace, someone
who would prove quite amenable to its whims and its des­
potism, someone on whom it could really count. Experi­
menting left and right, Disease suffered many a failure, until
at last it found man-unless it created him. Thus we are all
sick men, some potentially so-the mass of the healthy, the
type of placid, harmless humanity-the others actual, the
diseased strictly speaking, a cynical and impassioned mi­
nority. Two categories close in appearance, irreconcilable
in fact: a considerable gap separates possible pain from the
real thing.
Instead of turning against ourselves, against the fragility
of our complexion, we make others responsible for our
condition, for the slightest discomfort, even for a headache,
we accuse them of making us pay for their health, of being
nailed to our sickbed so that they can move about as they
72 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
choose. With what pleasure would we not see our disease,
or our discomfort, spread, gain a following, and if possible
extend to all humanity! Disappointed in our hopes, we re­
sent everyone, near or far, we harbor exterminating senti­
ments, we want others to be even more seriously threatened
than ourselves-let the hour of final agony, of a splendid
mutual annihilation, toll for all the living! Only great suf­
ferings, unforgettable sufferings, detach us from the world;
the others, average pains, morally the worst kind, enslave
us to it because they stir up the soul's lower depths. We
must be on guard against the sick, they have "character" and
can exploit and sharpen their rancors. One day, one of their
number decided never again to shake hands with a well
person; he soon discovered that many of those he had sus­
pected of health were at bottom unscathed by it. Then why
should he make enemies for himself on hasty suspicions?
From all evidence, this man was more reasonable than the
rest, and had scruples not habitual to the breed he belonged
to, a frustrated, insatiable, and prophetic gang which ought
to be isolated because it seeks to overturn the world in
order to impose its law. Instead, let us put matters in the
hands of the normal, the only ones disposed to leave things
as they are: indifferent to both past and future, they confine
themselves to the present, installing themselves there with­
out hopes and without regrets. But as soon as health wavers,
a man dreams of nothing but paradise and inferno, that is,
he reforms: he seeks to amend the irreparable, to redress or
demolish society, which he can no longer endure because
he can no longer endure himself. A man who suffers is a
public menace, a disequilibrated being, all the more fear­
some in that he usually has to conceal his pain, the source
of his energy. We cannot assert ourselves, or play a role
Odyssey of Rancor 73
here on earth, without help from some infirmity, and there
is no dynamism that is not the sign of physiological misery
or internal devastation. When we know equilibrium we care
for nothing, we do not even feel attached to life, for we are
life; once equilibrium is destroyed, instead of identifying
ourselves with things, we think of nothing but overthrowing
or molding them. Pride emanates from the tension and the
strain of consciousness, from the impossibility of existing
naively. Now the sick, never naive, substitute for the given
a false idea of it that they create, so that their perceptions
and even their reflexes participate in a system of obsessions
so imperious they cannot help codifying and inflicting them
on others, perfidious legislators concerned to make their
pains obligatory, in order to strike down those resolved not
to share them. If the healthy seem more accommodating, if
they have no reason to be intractable, it is because they are
unaware of the explosive virtues of humiliation. He who
has suffered humiliation will never forget its effects and will
know no rest until he has put them into a work capable
of perpetuating its pangs. To create is to bequeath one's
sufferings, wanting others to enter into them, to assume
them, to be impregnated by them, and to live them over
again. This is true of a poem, this can be true of the cos­
mos. Without the hypothesis of a feverish deity subject to
convulsions, giddy with epilepsy, we could not explain
a universe that . everywhere shows signs of an original
sputum . . . . And we divine the essence of such a God only
when we ourselves suffer fits such as He must have known
at the moments He came to grips with Chaos. We are re­
minded of Him by everything in ourselves that resists form
or good sense, by our confusions and our delirium: we join
Him by supplications in which we dislocate ourselves in
74 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
Him and Him in us, for He is close to us whenever some­
thing in ourselves breaks down and when, in our fashion,
we too measure ourselves against Chaos. A summary the­
ology? Contemplating this botched Creation, how can we
help incriminating its Author, how-above all-suppose
Him able and adroit? Any other God would have given
evidence of more competence or more equilibrium than
this one: errors and confusion wherever you look! Impos­
sible to absolve Him, but impossible, too, not to understand
Him. And we understand Him by everything in ourselves
that is fragmentary, incomplete, and inopportune. His en­
terprise bears the stigmata of the provisional, yet it is not
time He lacked in order to finish things off. He was, to our
misfortune, inexplicably rushed. By a legitimate ingratitude,
and to make Him feel the brunt of our ill humor, we set
about-experts in counter-Creation-deteriorating His
structure, rendering even messier a work already compro­
mised from the start. Doubtless it would be wiser and more
elegant to have nothing to do with it, to leave it as it is, not
to exact reprisal for His own incapacities; but since He has
transmitted His defects to us, we cannot show Him much
solicitude. If, all things considered, we prefer Him to hu­
manity, this does not exempt Him from our resentment.
Perhaps we have conceived Him only to justify and regen­
erate our rebellions, to afford them a worthy object, to keep
them from spoiling and dwindling, reinforcing them by the
inspiriting abuse of sacrilege, an answer to the arguments
and seductions of discouragement. We are never quite fin­
ished with God. Treating Him on equal footing as an enemy
is an impertinence that fortifies, stimulates, and how much
we must pity those He has ceased to annoy. What luck, on
the other hand, to be able without embarrassment to make
Odyssey of Rancor 75
Him assume responsibility for all our miseries, to over­
whelm and insult Him, to spare Him nothing at any moment,
not even in our prayers!
To rancor, on which we have no monopoly, He too is
subject (as many a Sacred Book attests), for solitude, how­
ever absolute, is no defense against it. That even for God
it is not good to be alone signifies, in short: let Us create
the world to have something to get back at, on which to
practice Our verve and Our victimization. And when the
world goes up in smoke, there remains, whether one is man
or God, this subtle form of vengeance: vengeance against
oneself, an absorbing occupation, anything but destructive
since it proves that one still makes terms with life, that one
adheres to it precisely by the tortures one inflicts upon
oneself. Hosanna is not one of our habits. Equally impure,
though in different ways, divine and diabolic principles are
easy to conceive of; angels, on the contrary, exceed our
grasp. And if we cannot quite envision them, if they fluster
our imagination, it is because, unlike God, the devil, and
all the rest of us, angels alone-when they are not the Ex­
terminating variety!-thrive without the spur of rancor. And­
need we add?-without that of flattery, which busy animals
like ourselves cannot do without. We depend, in order to
create, upon the opinion of our neighbors, we solicit, we
implore their homage, we mercilessly pursue those among
them who offer us nuanced or even equitable judgments,
and if we had the means, we should oblige them to bear
exaggerated, ridiculous ones, out of all proportion to our
aptitudes or our accomplishments. All measured praise being
identified with injustice, objectivity with provocation, re­
serve with insult, what keeps the universe from flinging itself
at our feet? What we crave, what we want to see in others'
76 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
eyes, is that servile expression, an unconcealed infatuation
with our gestures and our lucubrations, the avowal of an
ardor without second thoughts, an ecstasy before our noth­
ingness. A profiteering moralist-a psychologist paired with
a parasite-the flatterer knows our weakness and shame­
lessly exploits it. So far have we fallen that we accept all
excesses, premeditated and false claims of admiration, at
face value, without a blush, for we prefer the enthusiasms
of mendacity to the indictment of silence. Commingled with
our physiology, our viscera, flattery affects our glands, stim­
ulates our secretions, and seeks out, moreover, our basest
feelings, hence our most profound and natural ones, pro­
voking in us a second-rate euphoria to which we give our
flabbergasted attention; quite as flabbergasted, we contem­
plate the even more marked effects of censure, which invade
and overwhelm the very depths of our being. Since no one
rebukes us with impunity, we reply either by immediately
striking back or by generating gall, the equivalent of a sea­
soned riposte. Not to react would require a metamorphosis,
a total transformation not only of our dispositions, bur of
our organs themselves. Such an operation not being im­
minent, we bow with good grace to the maneuvers of flattery
and the sovereignty of rancor.
To repress the need for revenge is to try to dismiss time,
to deny events the possibility of occurring-it is to seek to
get rid of evil and, with it, of action. But action, a hunger
for defeat consubstantial with the self, is a fury over which
we triumph only at those moments when, weary of tor­
menting our enemies, we abandon them to their fate, leaving
them to rot because we do not love them enough to bother
to destroy them, to dissect them, to make them the object
of our nocturnal anatomies. Yet the frenzy comes upon us
Odyssey of Rancor 77
again, once that lust for appearances revives, that passion
for the absurd which constitutes our passion for existence.
Even reduced to the infinitesimal, life feeds on itself, tends
toward an increase of being, seeks to grow for no reason,
by a dishonoring and irrepressible automatism. One and the
same thirst devours gnat and elephant; with any luck it might
have been vanquished in humanity; we have seen that this
was not the case: the craving breaks out everywhere, with
increased intensity among the bedridden themselves. Ca­
pacity for desistance constitutes the sole criterion of spiritual
progress: it is not when things leave us, it is when we leave
them that we accede to an inner nakedness, to that extremity
where we no longer affiliate ourselves with this world or
with ourselves, and where victory signifies resignation, se­
rene self-renunciation without regrets and above all without
melancholy; for melancholy, discreet and aerial as it may
appear, still derives from resentment: it is a reverie stamped
with harshness, a jealousy disguised as languor, a vaporous
rancor, but rancor. As long as we remain in its power, we
desist from nothing, we are bogged down in the "I," yet
without release from others, whom we think of all the more
obsessively if we have not managed to prise ourselves loose
from . . . o urselves. At the very moment we promise our­
selves to vanquish vengeance, we feel it stirring within us
more powerfully than ever, ready to take the offensive.
"Forgiven" transgressions suddenly demand reparation, in­
vade our sleepless nights and, even more, our dreams, turn­
ing them into nightmares, venturing so deep into our abysses
that they end by forming their very substance. If this be so,
what is the use of acting out the farce of noble sentiments,
gambling on a metaphysical risk, or anticipating redemp­
tion? To take revenge, even if only in thought, is irreme-
78 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
diably to place ourselves on this side of the absolute. Absolute
indeed! Not only insults "forgotten" or silently endured,
but even those we have repaid, harass and haunt us to the
end of our days, and this obsession which should disqualify
us in our own eyes actually succors us, makes us eager for
battle. The slightest affront, a word, a glance tainted by some
restriction-these we never pardon a living person. Nor do
we even pardon such things after that person's death. The
image of his corpse doubtless assuages us and compels us
to indulgence; once the image blurs and in our memory the
face of the living man prevails over and replaces that of the
deceased, our old rancors rise up again, resume all the more
powerfully, with that whole procession of shames and hu­
miliations which will last as long as ourselves and whose
memory would be eternal, had immortality devolved upon
us.
Since everything wounds and insults us, why not swathe
ourselves in skepticism and try to find a remedy for our
distress? This would be only another deception, since Doubt
is merely a product of our irritations and our grievances­
the instrument a flayed man uses to suffer and to cause
suffering. If we demolish certainties, it is from no theoretical
scruple or in a playful spirit, but out of a craving to see
them vanish-also out of a desire that they belong to no
one, once they desert us and we possess none. And the
truth? By what right would others have access to the truth?
By what injustice would it be revealed to them, who are
worth less than ourselves? Have they striven, have they lain
awake to deserve it? While we labor in vain to attain truth,
they strut about as if it were set apart for them, as if they
were endowed with it by some providential decree. Yet
truth cannot be their appanage, and to keep them from
Odyssey of Rancor 79
laying claim to it, we convince them that when they imagine
they possess it, it is actually a fiction that they grasp. In
order to salve our own consciences, we delight in labeling
their bliss nothing but ostentation and arrogance, which
allows us to disturb them without remorse and, by inocu­
lating them with our stupors, to make them as vulnerable
and wretched as ourselves. Skepticism is the sadism of em­
bittered souls.
The more stress we lay on our torments, the more in­
separable they seem from our unredeemed condition. The
maximum detachment to which we can lay claim is a position
equidistant from vengeance and from pardon, halfway be­
tween a resentment and a generosity equally limp and spent,
since destined to neutralize one another. But to slough off
the old Adam-that we shall never manage, even if we were
to carry horror of ourselves to the point of forever re­
nouncing any rank at all in the hierarchy of beings.
Mechanism of Utopia
Whenever I happen to be in a city of any size, I marvel that
riots do not break out every day: massacres, unspeakable
carnage, a doomsday chaos. How can so many human beings
coexist in a space so confined without destroying each other,
without hating each other to death? As a matter of fact, they
do hate each other, but they are not equal to their hatred.
And it is this mediocrity, this impotence, that saves society,
that assures its continuance, its stability. Occasionally some
shock occurs by which our instincts profit; but afterward we
go on looking each other in the face as if nothing had hap­
pened, cohabiting without too obviously tearing each other
to shreds. Order is restored, a ferocious calm as dreadful,
ultimately, as the frenzy that had interrupted it.
Yet I marvel still more that some of us, society being
what it is, have ventured to conceive another one alto­
gether-a different society. What can be the cause of so
much naivete, or of so much inanity? If the question is
normal enough, even ordinary, the curiosity that led me to
ask it, on the other hand, has the excuse of being morbid.
Seeking new evidence, and just as I despaired of finding
anything of the kind, it occurred to me to consult utopian
literature, to steep myself in its "masterpieces," to wallow
80
Mechanism of Utopia 81
in them. There, to my great delight, I sated my pentitential
longings, my appetite for mortification. To spend months
recording the dreams of a better future, of an "ideal" society,
devouring the unreadable-what a windfall! I hasten to add
that this tedious literature has much to teach, and that time
spent frequenting it is not entirely wasted. From the start,
one discerns in it the (fruitful or calamitous) role taken, in
the genesis of events, not by happiness but by the idea of
happiness, an idea that explains-the Age of Iron being
coextensive with history-why each epoch so eagerly in­
vokes the Age of Gold. Suppose we put an end to such
speculations: total stagnation would ensue. For we act only
under the fascination of the impossible: which is to say that
a society incapable of generating-and of dedicating itself
to-a utopia is threatened with sclerosis and collapse. Wis­
dom-fascinated by nothing-recommends an existing, a
given happiness, which man rejects, and by this very rejec­
tion becomes a historical animal, that is, a devotee of imag­
ined happiness.
"A new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away," we read in Revelations.
Cross out "heaven," just keep the "new earth," and you
have the secret and the recipe of all utopian systems; for
greater precision, perhaps you should put "city" for "earth";
but that is only a detail; what counts is the prospect of a
new advent, the fever of an essential expectation-a de­
based, modernized Parousia from which arise those systems
so dear to the disinherited. Poverty is in fact the utopianist's
great auxiliary, it is the matter he works in, the substance
on which he feeds his thoughts, the providence of his ob­
sessions. Without poverty he would be empty; but poverty
82 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
occupies him, allures or embarrasses him, depending on
whether he is poor or rich; from another point of view,
poverty cannot do without him-it needs this theoretician,
this adept of the future, especially since poverty itself, that
endless meditation on the likelihood of escaping its own
present, would hardly endure its dreariness without the ob­
session of another earth. Can you doubt it? If so, it is because
you have not tasted utter indigence. Do so and you will see
that the more destitute you are, the more time and energy
you will spend in reforming everything, in thinking-in
other words, in vain. I have in mind not only institutions,
human creations: those of course you will condemn straight
off and without appeal; but objects, all objects, however
insignificant. Unable to accept them as they are, you will
want to impose your laws and your whims upon them, to
function at their expense as legislator or as tyrant; you will
even want to intervene in the life of elements in order to
modify their physiognomy, their structure. Air annoys you:
let it be transformed! And stone as well. And the same for
the vegetal world, the same for man. Down past the foun­
dations of being, down to the strata of chaos, descend, install
yourself there! When you haven't a penny in your pocket,
you strive, you dream, how extravagantly you labor to pos­
sess All, and as long as the frenzy lasts, you do possess that
All, you equal God, though no one realizes it, not even
God, not even you. The delirium of the poor is the generator
of events, the source of history: a throng of hysterics who
want another world, here and now. It is they who inspire
utopias, it is for them that utopias are written. But utopia,
let us remember, means nowhere.
And where would these cities be that evil never touches,
in which labor is blessed and death is never feared? There
Mechanism of Utopia 83
one is constrained to a felicity of geometric idylls, of ad­
justed ecstasies, of a thousand disgusting wonders neces­
sarily offered by the spectacle of a perfect world, a fabricated
world. In ludicrous detail, Campanella tells us about the
Solarians exempt from "gout, rheumatism, catarrh, sciatica,
colic, hydropsy flatus . . . ." Everything abounds in the City
of the Sun "because each man is eager to distinguish himself
in what he does. The leader who presides over each thing
is called: King . . . . W omen and men, divided into bands, go
about their work without ever infringing the orders of their
kings, and without ever appearing fatigued, as we do. They
regard their leaders as fathers or as older brothers." We
shall recognize the same twaddle in other works of the genre,
particularly in those of a Cabet, a Fourier, or a Morris, all
lacking in that touch of rancor so necessary to literary works,
and not only those.
To conceive a true utopia, to sketch, with conviction, the
structure of an ideal society, requires a certain dose of in­
genuousness, even of stupidity, which, being too evident,
ultimately exasperates the reader. The only readable utopias
are the false ones, the ones that, written in a spirit of en­
tertainment or misanthropy, prefigure or recall Gulliver's
Travels, that Bible of the disabused, quintessence of non­
chimerical visions, a utopia without hope. By his sarcasms,
Swift undeceived a genre to the point of destroying it.
Is it easier to confect a utopia than an apocalypse? Both
have their principles and their stereotypes. The former, whose
cliches are closer to our deepest instincts, has given rise to
a much more abundant literature than the latter. Not every­
one can reckon with a cosmic catastrophe or love the lan­
guage and the style with which it is heralded and proclaimed.
84 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
Bue he who acknowledges and applauds such an idea will
read, in the Gospels, with all the enthusiasm of vice, the
figures and banalities that will prosper on Patmos: "The scars
of heaven shall fall unto the earth, and the moon become
as blood . . . a ll the tribes of the earth shall lament . . . n or
shall this generation perish before all these things are come
to pass." This presentiment of the incredible, of a capital
event, this crucial expectation can turn into an illusion, which
will be the hope of a paradise on earth or elsewhere; or else
it can turn into anxiety, and this will be the vision of an
ideal Worst, a voluptuously dreaded cataclysm.
"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it
he should smite the nations." Conventions of horror, rou­
tine procedures. Saint John had to go in for them, once he
opted for chat splendid gibberish, that procession of down­
falls preferable, all things considered, to the descriptions of
cities and islands where you are smothered by an impersonal
bliss, where "universal harmony" crushes you in its embrace.
The dreams of utopia have for the most part been realized,
but in an entirely different spirit from the one in which they
had been conceived; what was perfection for utopia is for
us a flaw; its chimeras are our disasters. The type of society
conceived by utopia in a lyrical tonality seems to us, in
operation, intolerable. Judge from the following sample of
Caber's Voyage en Icarie: "Two-thousand five-hundred young
women (dressmakers) work in a factory, some sitting, some
standing, almost all charming . . . . T he rule that each worker
produces the same object doubles the rapidity of the man­
ufacture and brings it to perfection as well. Thousands of
items of the most elegant headware are created each morn­
ing by the hands of these lovely workers." Such lucubrations
proceed from mental debility or bad taste. And yet Cabet
Mechanism of Utopia 85
has, in material terms, seen quite accurately; he is mistaken
only with regard to the essential. Utterly uninstructed as to
the interval that separates being and producing (we exist, in
the full sense of the word, only outside of what we do, only
beyond our actions), he could not discern the fatality at­
tached to every form of labor, artisanal, industrial, or oth­
erwise. What is most striking in utopian narratives is the
absence of perspicacity, of psychological instinct. Their char­
acters are automatons, fictions or symbols: none is real, none
exceeds its puppet status, an idea lost in a universe without
reference points. Even the children become unrecognizable.
In Fourier's "societary state," they are so pure that they are
utterly unaware of the temptation to steal, to "pick an apple
off a tree." But a child who does not steal is not a child.
What is the use of creating a society of marionettes? I rec­
ommend the description of the phalanstery as the most ef­
fective vomitive I know.
Placed at the antipodes of a La Rochefoucauld, the in­
ventor of utopias is a moralist who perceives in us only
disinterest, craving for sacrifice, self-effacement. Bloodless,
perfect, and nil, thunderstruck by Good, stripped of sins
and vices, with neither depth nor contour, utterly unini­
tiated into existence, into the art of embarrassment, of vary­
ing one's shames and torments, such men never suspect the
pleasure that our neighbor's despair provokes in us, the
impatience with which we anticipate and follow his downfall.
This impatience and this pleasure can, on occasion, proceed
from a proper curiosity, with nothing diabolical about it. As
long as someone rises in the world, we do not know who
he is, for-his ascent distancing him from himself.-he lacks
reality, he does not exist. Similarly, we know ourselves only
from the moment when we begin to fail, when any success,
86 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
on the level of human interests, turns out to be impossible:
a perspicuous defeat by which, taking possession of our own
being, we stand apart from the universal torpor. The better
to grasp your own collapse or another's, you must pass through
evil and, if need be, plunge deep within it: how manage this
in those islands and cities from which it is excluded by
principle, by raison d'etat? Here all shadows are forbidden;
only light is admitted. No trace of dualism: utopia is by
essence anti-Manichean. Hostile to anomaly, to deformity,
to irregularity, it tends to the affirmation of the homoge­
neous, of the typical, of repetition and orthodoxy. But life
is rupture, heresy, derogation from the norms of matter.
And man, in relation to life, is heresy to the second degree,
victory of the individual, of whim, aberrant apparition, a
schismatic animal that society-the totality of sleeping mon­
sters-seeks to recall to the straight and narrow path. Her­
etic par excellence, the wakened monster, an incarnate
solitude, infraction of the universal order, delights in his
exception, isolates himself in his onerous privileges, and it
is in duration that he pays for what he gains over his "kind":
the more he distinguishes himself from them, the more
dangerous and simultaneously the more fragile he will be,
for it is at the cost of his longevity that he disturbs the
others' peace and that he creates for himself, there in the
heart of the city, an undesirable standing.
"Our hopes for the future state of the human race can be
reduced to these three important points: the destruction of
inequality among nations, the progress of equality within
one and the same people, and finally the perfecting of hu­
manity." (Condorcet)
Committed to the description of real cities, history, which
Mechanism of Utopia 87
always and everywhere asseverates the failure rather than
the fulfillment of our hopes, has ratified none of these fore­
casts. For a Tactitus, there is no ideal Rome.
By banishing the irrational and the irreparable, utopia
further sets itself against tragedy, paroxysm and quintes­
sence of history. In a perfect city, all conflict would cease;
human wills would be throttled, mollified, or rendered mi­
raculously convergent; here would reign only unity, without
the ingredient of chance or contradiction. Utopia is a mix­
ture of childish rationalism and secularized angelism ..
We are submerged in evil. Not that all our actions are
bad; but, when we happen to commit good ones, we suffer
from them, for having thwarted our spontaneous impulses:
the practice of virtue comes down to an exercise of peni­
tence, an apprenticeship to maceration. Fallen angel trans­
formed into a demiurge assigned to Creation, Satan rebels
against God and reveals himself, here below, more at ease
and even more powerful than He; far from being a usurper,
he is our master, a legitimate sovereign who would prevail
over the Most High, if the universe were reduced to man.
So let us have the courage to acknowledge whom we are
responsible to.
The great religions have not been deceived: what Mara
offers to Buddha, Ahriman to Zoroaster, the Tempter to
Jesus, is the earth and supremacy over the earth, realities
well within the power of the Prince of this world. And we
are playing his game, cooperating in his enterprise and ful­
filling it when we seek to establish a new realm, a generalized
utopia or a universal empire, for what he craves above all
is that we embroil ourselves with him and that upon his
contact we turn away from the light, from the regret for our
old felicity.
88 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
Closed for five thousand years, paradise was reopened, ac­
cording to Saint John Chrysostom, at the moment when
Christ expired; the thief could enter it now, followed by
Adam, repatriated at last, and by a limited number of the
Just who were vegetating in the infernal regions, waiting for
"the hour of redemption."
Everything suggests that paradise has been bolted shut
again and that it will remain so for a long time to come. No
one can force an entrance there: the few privileged char­
acters enjoying the place have doubtless barricaded them­
selves inside, according to a system whose wonders they
could observe on earth. This paradise has a look of being
the real one: in the depths of our prostrations we dream of
it and in it long to dissolve. A sudden impulse leads us to
it, and we plunge in: do we seek to regain, in a moment,
what we have lost forever-suddenly to make up for the
sin of being born? Nothing shows more clearly the meta­
physical meaning of our nostalgia than its incapacity to co­
incide with any moment of time whatever; hence it seeks
consolation in a remote, immemorial past refractory to the
centuries and somehow anterior to becoming. The evil from
which our nostalgia suffers-effect of a rupture that dates
back to the beginnings-keeps it from projecting the Age
of Gold into the future; the.golden age it conceives quite
naturally is the old one, the primordial one to which it
aspires less for pleasure's sake than to swoon there, to lay
down the burden of consciousness. If we return to the source
of all seasons, of time itself, it is to rediscover the true
paradise there, object of all our regrets. On the other hand,
the nostalgia from which the earthly paradise derives will
be minus precisely the dimension of regret: a nostalgia re­
versed, falsified, and vitiated, straining toward the future,
Mechanism of Utopia 89
obnubilated by ''progress," a temporal rejoinder, a jeering
metamorphosis of the original paradise. Contagion? Au­
tomatism? This metamorphosis has ultimately come to pass
within each of us. Willy-nilly we bet on the future, make it
into a panacea, and identifying it with the appearance of an
altogether different time within time, we consider it as an
inexhaustible and yet completed duration, a timeless history.
A contradiction in terms, inherent in the hope of a new
kingdom, of a victory of the unsolvable at the heart of be­
coming. Our dreams of a better world are based on a the­
oretical impossibility. Hardly surprising if, in order to justify
them, we must resort to solid paradoxes!
As long as Christianity satisfied men's minds, utopia could
not seduce them; once Christianity began to disappoint them,
utopia sought to conquer them and to establish itself there.
It was already hard at work during the Renaissance, but was
not to succeed until two centuries later, in an age of "en­
lightened" superstitions. Thus was born the Future, vision
of an irrevocable happiness, of a maneuvered paradise in
which chance has no place, in which the merest fantasy
seems like a heresy or a provocation. To describe such a
thing would be to enter into the details of the unimaginable.
The very notion of an ideal city is a torment to reason, an
enterprise that does honor to the heart and disqualifies the
intellect. (How could a Plato condescend to such a thing?
He is the ancestor, I was forgetting, of all these aberrations,
revived and aggravated by Thomas More, the founder of
modern illusions.) To construct a society where, according
to a terrifying ceremony, our acts are catalogued and reg­
ulated, where, by a charity carried to the point of indecency,
our innermost thoughts are inspected, is to transfer the
90 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
pangs of hell to the Age of Gold, or to create, with the
devil's help, a philanthropic institution. Solarians, Utopians,
Harmonians-their hideous names resemble their fate, a
nightmare promised to us as well, since we ourselves have
erected it into an ideal.
In preaching the advantages of labor, utopias would take
the opposite tack from Genesis. On this point especially,
they are the expression of a humanity engulfed in toil, proud
of conniving with the consequences of the Fall, of which
the gravest remains the obsession with profit. The stigmata
of a race that cherishes "the sweat of the brow'' and makes
it a sign of nobility, that labors exultantly-these we bear
with pride and ostentation; whence the horror inspired in
us, reprobates as we are, by the elect who refuse to toil or
to excel in any realm whatever. The refusal we reproach
them for is one that only the man who preserves the memory
of an immemorial happiness is capable of. Alienated among
his kind, he is like them and yet cannot communicate with
them; whichever way he looks, he does not feel he is from
hereabouts; whatever he discerns seems to him a usurpation:
the very fact of bearing a name . . . H is enterprises fail, he
ventures upon them without believing in them: simulacra
from which the precise image of another world alienates him.
Man, once expelled from paradise, in order not to think
about it anymore, in order not to suffer from it, is given in
compensation the faculty of will, of aspiring to action, of
foundering there with enthusiasm, with brio. . . . B ut the
abulic, in his detachment, in his supernatural marasmus­
what effort can he make, to what goal can he abandon him­
self? Nothing induces him to emerge from his . . . a bsence.
And yet he himself does not entirely escape the common
curse: he exhausts himself in a regret and expends on it more
energy than we deploy in all our exploits.
Mechanism of Utopia 91
When Christ promised that the "kingdom of God" was nei­
ther "here" nor "there," but within us, he doomed in ad­
vance the utopian constructions for which any "kingdom"
is necessarily exterior, with no relation to our inmost self or
our individual salvation. So deeply have utopias marked us,
that it is from outside, from the course of events or from
the progress of collectivities that we await our deliverance.
Thus was devised the Meaning of history, whose vogue
would supplant that of Progress, without adding anything
new to it. Yet it was necessary to shelve not a concept, but
one of its verbal translations, which had been abused. In
ideological matters, we are not easily renewed without the
help of synonyms.
Various as are its disguises, the notion of perfectibility
has made its way into our manners: to it subscribes even
the man who questions it. That history just unfolds, inde­
pendently of a specified direction, of a goal, no one is willing
to admit. "A Goal-surely it has one, races toward it, has
all but reached it," proclaim our doctrines and our desires.
The more heavily an idea is burdened with immediate prom­
ises, the greater likelihood it has of triumphing. Unable to
find "the kingdom of God" within themselves, or rather too
cunning to want to seek it there, Christians placed it in the
course of events-in becoming: they perverted a teaching
in order to ensure its success. Furthermore, Christ himself
sustained the ambiguity; on one hand, answering the in­
sinuations of the Pharisees, he recommended an interior
kingdom, remote from time; and on the other he signified
to his disciples that, salvation being imminent, they and the
"present generation" would witness the consummation of
all things. Having understood that human beings accept mar­
tyrdom for a chimera but not for a truth, he came to terms
with their weakness. Had he acted otherwise, he would have
92 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
compromised his work. But what in him was concession or
tactic is in the utopianists postulate or passion.
A great step forward was made the day men understood
that, in order to torment one another more effectively, they
would have to gather together, to organize themselves into
a society. If we are to believe the utopias, they succeeded
in doing so only by halves; the utopias therefore offer to
help them, to furnish them a context appropriate to the
exercise of a complete happiness, while requiring, in return,
that men abdicate their freedom or, if they retain it, that
they use it solely to proclaim their joy amid the sufferings
they inflict upon each other. Such seems the meaning of the
infernal solicitude the utopias show toward men. Under
these conditions, how can we fail to envisage a reverse uto­
pia, a liquidation of the infinitesimal good and the enormous
evil attached to the existence of any social order whatever?
The project is alluring, the temptation irresistible. How put
an end to so vast an amount of anomalies? It would require
something comparable to the universal dissolvent sought by
the alchemists and whose efficacy would be tested not on
metals but on institutions. Until the formula is found, let
us note in passing that in their positive aspects, alchemy and
utopia coincide: pursuing, in heterogeneous realms, a dream
of transmutation that is related if not identical, one attacks
the irreducible in nature, the other the irreducible in history.
And it is from one and the same spiritual vice, or from one
and the same hope, that the elixir of life and the ideal city
derive.
Just as a nation, in order to set itself apart from the others,
in order to humiliate and overwhelm them, or simply in
order to acquire a unique physiognomy, needs an extrava-
Mechanism of Utopia 93
gant idea to guide it, to propose goals incommensurable
with its real capacities, so a society evolves and asserts itself
only if ideals are suggested to it, or inculcated in it, out of
all proportion to what it is. Utopia fulfills, in the life of
collectivities, the function assigned to the notion of "mis­
sion" in the life of peoples. Hence ideologies are the by­
product and, in a sense, the vulgar expression of messianic
or utopian visions.
In itself an ideology is neither good nor bad. Everything
depends on the moment when it is adopted. Communism,
for example, acts upon a virile nation like a stimulant; it
impels it onward and favors its expansion; on a tottering
nation, its influence may be less happy. Neither true nor
false, it precipitates matters, and it is not because of it but
through it that Russia acquired its present vigor. Would it
play the same part, once established throughout the rest of
Europe? Would it be a principle of renewal? One would
like to hope so; in any case, the question admits of only an
indirect, an arbitrary answer, inspired by analogies of a his­
torical order. Let us reflect upon the effects of Christianity
at its beginnings: it delivered a fatal blow to ancient society,
paralyzed it, finished it off; on the other hand, it was a
blessing to the Barbarians, whose instincts were enhanced
upon contact. Far from regenerating a decrepit world, it
regenerated only the regenerated. In the same fashion, com­
munism will bring about, in the immediate future, the sal­
vation of only those who are already saved; it cannot provide
a concrete hope to the moribund, still less can it reanimate
corpses.
After having denounced the absurdities of utopia, let us
deal with its merits, and, since men accommodate social
arrangements so well and scarcely distinguish from them the
94 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
evils immanent within them, let us do as they do, let us
unite ourselves with their unconsciousness.
We shall never praise the utopias sufficiently for having
denounced the crimes of ownership, the horror property
represents, the calamities it causes. Great or small, the owner
is corrupted, sullied in his essence: his corruption is pro­
jected onto the merest object he touches or appropriates.
Whether his "fortune" is threatened or stripped from him,
he will be compelled to a consciousness of which he is
normally incapable. In order to reassume a human appear­
ance, in order to regain his "soul," he must be ruined and
must consent to his ruin. In this, the revolution will help
him. By restoring him to his primal nakedness, it annihilates
him in the immediate future and saves him in the absolute,
for it liberates-inwardly, it is understood-those whom it
strikes first: the haves; it reclassifies them, it restores to them
their former dimension and leads them back to the values
they have betrayed. But even before having the means or
the occasion to strike them, the revolution sustains in them
a salutary fear: it troubles their sleep, nourishes their night­
mares, and nightmare is the beginning of a metaphysical
awakening. Hence it is as an agent of destruction that the
revolution is seen to be useful; however deadly, one thing
always redeems it: it alone knows what kind of terror to use
in order to shake up this world of owners, the cruelest of
all possible worlds. Every form of possession, let us not
hesitate to insist, degrades, debases, flatters the monster
sleeping deep within each of us. To own even a broom, to
count anything at all as our property, is to participate in the
general infamy. What pride to discover that nothing belongs
to you-what a revelation! You took yourself for the last
of men, and now, suddenly, astonished and virtually en-
Mechanism of Utopia 95
lightened by your destitution, you no longer suffer from it;
quite the contrary, you pride yourself in it. And all you still
desire is to be as indigent as a saint or a madman.
When we are exasperated by traditional values, we neces­
sarily orient ourselves toward the ideology that denies them.
And it is by its force of negation that utopia seduces, much
more than by its positive formulas. To desire the overthrow
of the social order is to pass through a crisis more or less
marked by communist themes. This is true today, as it was
true yesterday and will be true even tomorrow. Everything
suggests that, since the Renaissance, men's minds have been
attracted on the surface by liberalism, and in depth by com­
munism, which, far from being a product of circumstances,
a historical accident, is the heir of utopian systems and the
beneficiary of a long subterranean labor; initially a caprice
or a schism, it was ultimately to assume the character of a
destiny and an orthodoxy. At the present time, our con­
sciousness can waken to only two forms of revolt: com­
munist and anticommunist. Yet how can we fail to realize
that anticommunism is equivalent to a furious, horrified faith
in the future of communism?
When an ideology's moment has come, everything con­
tributes to its success, even its enemies; neither polemics
nor police can check its expansion or delay its success; it
seeks, and it is able, to realize itself, to incarnate itself; but
the better it succeeds, the greater risk it runs of exhausting
itself; once established, it will be drained of its ideal content,
will extenuate its resources, compromising the promises of
salvation it possessed, only to degenerate at the end into a
bugbear or humbug.
The career reserved for communism depends on the rate
96 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
at which it expends its utopian reserves. So long as it pos­
sesses them, it will inevitably tempt all societies that have
not experienced such a thing; retreating here, advancing
there, invested with virtues no other ideology possesses, it
will circle the earth, replacing defunct or declining religions,
and everywhere offering the modern crowd an absolute wor­
thy of its nothingness.
Considered in itself, communism appears as the only real­
ity to which one might still subscribe, if one harbors even
a wisp of illusion as to the future: this is why, to various
degrees, we are all communists . . . . But is it not a sterile
speculation to judge a doctrine apart from the anomalies
inherent in its practical realization? Man will always antic­
ipate the advent of justice; for justice to triumph, he will
renounce freedom, which he will afterward regret. What­
ever he undertakes, this impasse haunts his actions and his
thoughts, as if it were not its final term but its point of
departure, its condition, and its key. No new social form is
in a position to safeguard the advantages of the old: a vir­
tually equal amount of disadvantages is encountered in all
types of society. A cursed equilibrium, an irremediable stag­
nation, from which individuals and collectivities suffer alike.
Theories can do nothing about it, the depths of history being
impermeable to the doctrines that mark its appearance. The
Christian era was quite a different thing from Christianity;
the communist era, in its turn, cannot evoke communism
as such. There exists no event that is naturally Christian, or
naturally communist.
If utopia was illusion hypostasized, communism, going still
further, will be illusion decreed, imposed: a challenge to
the omnipresence of evil, an obligatory optimism. A man will
Mechanism of Utopia 97
find it hard to accommodate himself to it if he lives, by dint
of ordeals and experiments, in the intoxication of disap­
pointment and if, like the author of Genesis, he is reluctant
to identify the Age of Gold with the future, with becoming.
Not that he scorns the fanatics of "infinite progress" and
their efforts to make justice prevail here on earth; but he
knows, to his misery, that justice is a material impossibility,
a grandiose meaninglessness, the only ideal about which we
can declare quite certainly that it will never be realized, and
against which nature and society seem to have mobilized all
their laws.
These factions, these conflicts are not uniquely those of
a solitary. With more or less intensity, we too endure them,
all the rest of us: are we not at the point of longing for the
destruction of this very society, even while knowing the
misadventures reserved for us by the one that will replace
it? A total overthrow, however useless, a revolution without
faith is all we can still hope for from a period in which no
one is sufficiently honest to be a true revolutionary. When,
tormented by the frenzy of the intellect, we give ourselves
up to that of chaos, we react like a madman in possession
of his faculties, a lunatic superior to his lunacy, or like a
god who, in a fit of lucid rage, delights in pulverizing his
work and his being.
Our dreams of the future are henceforth inseparable from
our fears. Utopian literature, at its beginnings, rebelled against
the Middle Ages, against the high esteem in which they held
Hell and against the taste they professed for doomsday vi­
sions. It seems as if the reassuring systems of a Campanella
or a More were conceived with the sole purpose of dis­
crediting the hallucinations of a Saint Hildegarde. Today,
reconciled with the terrible, we are seeing a contamination
98 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
of utopia by apocalypse: the heralded "new earth" increas­
ingly assumes the aspect of a new Hell. But this Hell is one
we are waiting for, we even make it a duty to precipitate
its advent. The two genres, utopian and apocalyptic, which
once seemed so dissimilar to us, interpenetrate, rub off on
each other, to form a third, wonderfully apt to reflect the
kind of reality that threatens us and to which we shall none­
theless assent with a correct and disabused yes. That will be
our way of being irreproachable in the face of fatality.
The Golden Age
I
"In those days, men lived like gods, free of care, knowing
neither labor nor pain. Old age and its miseries never visited
them, and retaining the strength of their hands and limbs
as long as they lived, they feasted in delight, shielded from
all harm. Men died as if they fell asleep, overcome by no
more than drowsiness. Every good was theirs; the fertile
land afforded plentiful nourishment of itself, and men ate
and drank at their pleasure . . . .
"
Hesiod's portrait of the golden age matches that of the
biblical Eden. One is as conventional as the other: unreality
cannot be dramatic. At least they share the merit of defining
the image of a static world where identity ceaselessly con­
templates itself, ruled by an eternal present, that tense com­
mon to all visions of paradise, a time forged in opposition
to the very idea of time. In order to conceive and aspire to
it, we must execrate all becoming, having endured its weight,
its calamity; we must long to wrest ourselves free of it at
any cost. This longing is the only one a feeble will is capable
of, a will eager to rest, to dissolve . . . e lsewhere. Had we
adhered without reservation to the eternal present, history
99
100 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
would not have occurred, or in any case would not have
been synonymous with burden, with torment. When it weighs
too heavily upon us, when it overwhelms us, a nameless
cowardice seizes upon our being: the prospect of further
struggles among the centuries assumes nightmare propor­
tions. The accommodations of that mythological age allure
us then to the point of pain, or if we have frequented Gen­
esis, the divagations of regret transplant us into the happy
stupors of the first garden, while our mind evokes the angels
and turns itself inside out to penetrate their secret. The
more we think about them, the higher they rise out of our
lassitude, not without some advantage to ourselves: do they
not permit us to appreciate the degree of our inaptitude for
the world, of our awkwardness in getting ourselves into it?
However impalpable, however unreal they may be, yet they
are less so than we who brood upon them and invoke them,
shadows or counterfeit shadows, desiccated flesh, annihi­
lated breath. And it is with all our wretchedness, as op­
pressed ghosts, that we ponder them, beseeching . . . . T here
is nothing "terrible" in their nature, as a certain elegy claims;
no, what is terrible is to have reached the point of being
able to deal with nothing but them, or, when we suppose
them a thousand miles away from us, suddenly to see them
emerging from the twilight of our own flesh and blood.
II
As for the "sources of life," which the gods, according to
Hesiod again, have hidden from us, it was Prometheus who
took it upon himself to reveal them. Responsible for all our
misfortunes, he was quite unaware of being so, though he
The Golden Age 101
prided himself in his lucidity. The remarks Aeschylus puts
in his mouth are word for word the contrary of those we
have just read in Works and Days: "In those days, men saw,
but saw badly; they listened, but failed to under­
stand . . . . T hey took action, but never realized what they
were doing." We recognize the tone-no use quoting any
further. What Prometheus reproached men for, after all,
was their plunge into the primordial idyll, their conformity
to the laws of their nature, unbroached by consciousness.
By wakening them to mind, by separating them from those
"sources" they had previously enjoyed without attempting
to sound their depths or their significance, he brought them
not happiness but the curse and the torments of titanism.
They were doing very well without consciousness; he came
to inflict it upon them, to nail them to it, and consciousness
provoked within them a drama which extends to each of us
and will end only with the race itself. With every passing
day, consciousness gains a greater hold over us, dominates
us, tears us away from life; we try clinging to life anew and,
failing, turn against life and consciousness both, then we
weigh their meaning and their donnees, until, exasperated,
we turn against ourselves. This he had not anticipated, our
deadly philanthropist whose sole excuse was illusion, a tempter
in spite of himself, a feckless and blundering serpent. Men
listened; what need did they have to understand? Prometheus
obliged them to do so, handing them over to becoming, to
history; in other words, driving them out of the eternal
present. Innocent or guilty, what does it matter: Prometheus
deserved his punishment.
The first zealot of "science," a modern in the worst sense
of the word, his heroics and his ravings herald those of many
a doctrinaire of the last century: only his sufferings console
102 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
us for so many extravagances. Now that eagle-there is
someone who understood and who, divining our future, sought
to spare us its horrors. But the machine had been started:
men had already acquired a taste for the wiles of the seducer
who, modeling them in his own image, taught them to rum­
mage, like himself, in the underside of life, despite the pro­
hibition of the gods. Prometheus is the instigator of all the
indiscretions and misdemeanors of knowledge, the source
of that murderous curiosity which keeps us from marrying
the world: by idealizing knowledge and action, did he not
thereby ruin Being, and with Being, the possibility of the
golden age? The tribulations to which he doomed us, if not
equal to his, would nonetheless last longer. His "program,"
coherent as fatality, he realized to perfection, only in re­
verse; everything he preached to us, everything he imposed
upon us has turned point by point first against him, then
against us. One does not shake off original unconsciousness
with impunity; those who, following his lead, cast aspersions
upon it inexorably suffer his fate: they are devoured, they
too have their rock and their eagle. And the hatred with
which they thank him is all the more virulent in that they
hate themselves in him.
III
The transition of the silver age, then to that of bronze and
of iron, marks the progress of our downfall, of our alienation
from that eternal present of which we conceive no more
than a simulacrum and with which we have ceased to have
a common frontier: it belongs to another universe, it eludes
us, and we are so distinct from it that we barely succeed in
The Golden Age 103
suspecting its nature. No way of appropriating it: did we
ever really possess it? And how regain our footing there
when nothing restores its image in us, for us? We are forever
thwarted, and if we ever do approach it, the merit of our
success goes to those extremities of satiety and sluggishness
wherein it is, however, no more than a caricature of itself,
a parody of the immutable, a prostrate becoming frozen in
a timeless avarice, huddled over a sterile moment, over a
treasure which impoverishes it-a spectral becoming, pow­
erless and yet fulfilled, stuffed as it is with the void. For
beings to whom ecstasy was forbidden, no glimpse of origin,
save by the extinction of their vitality, by the absence of
any attribute, by that sensation of hollow infinity, of a cheap­
ened abyss, of inflated space and of a suppliant, spoiled
duration.
There is an authentic, positive eternity, which extends
beyond time; there is another one, negative and false, lo­
cated within it: that eternity in which we stagnate, far from
salvation, outside the competence of any redeemer, and
which liberates us from everything by depriving us of every­
thing. The universe impoverished, we exhaust ourselves in
the spectacle of our own appearances. Has it atrophied,
then, the organ that once allowed us to perceive the depths
of our being? And are we forever reduced to our sem­
blances? When a list is someday made of all the ills the flesh
and spirit are heir to, they will still be as nothing to the one
that comes from our incapacity to marry ourselves to the
eternal present, or to steal from it, for our delight, even the
tiniest fraction.
Fallen without recourse into a negative eternity, into that
scattered time which affirms itself only by annulling itself,
an essence reduced to a series of destructions, a summa of
104 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
ambiguities, a plenitude whose principle abides in the void,
we live and die in each of its moments without knowing
when it is, for in truth it never is. For all its precariousness,
we are so attached to it that in order to tear ourselves from
it, we require more than an eruption of our habits: a lesion
of the mind, a crack in the self, through which we might
glimpse the indestructible and gain access to it, a favor granted
only to certain reprobates in recompense for their assent to
their own destruction. The rest-the great majority of mor­
tals, while avowing their incapacity for such a sacrifice, never
renounce the quest for another time; they devote themselves
to it, on the contrary, with desperation, but locate it here
on earth, according to the prescriptions of utopia, which
seek to reconcile the eternal present with history, the de­
lights of the golden age with Promethean ambitions, or, to
resort to biblical terminology, to remake Eden with the
instruments of the Fall, thereby permitting the new Adam
to know the advantages of the old one. Is this not to attempt
to revise the Creation?
IV
Vico's notion of constructing an "ideal history" and of trac­
ing its "eternal circle" is recognizable, applied to society, in
the utopian systems characterized by their effort to solve
the "social question" once and for all. Whence their ob­
session with the definitive and their impatience to institute
paradise as soon as possible, in the immediate future, a kind
of stationary duration, an immobilized Possible, a counter­
feit of the eternal present. "If I prophesy," says Fourier, "so
unhesitatingly the universal harmony as an imminent phe-
The Golden Age 105
nomenon, it is because the organization of the societary state
requires no more than two years . . . ." A na.lve avowal if
ever there was one, which betrays, nonetheless, a profound
reality. Would we fling ourselves into even the flimsiest
enterprise without the secret conviction that the absolute
depends upon us, our ideas, our actions, and that we can
guarantee their triumph in a short period of time? Any man
who identifies himself completely with something behaves
as if he were anticipating the advent of "the universal har­
mony," or considered himself its promoter. To act is to
anchor in an imminent future, so imminent it becomes al­
most tangible; to act is to feel you are consubstantial with
that future. Which is not the case for those persecuted by
the demon of procrastination. "What can be usefully post­
poned can be even more usefully abandoned," they repeat
with Epictetus, though their passion for postponement does
not proceed, as it does for the Stoic, from any moral con­
sideration, but from an almost methodical dread and from
a disgust too inveterate not to assume the qualities of a
discipline or a vice. If they have proscribed the before and
the after, evacuated today and tomorrow as equally unin­
habitable, it is because it is easier for them to live in imag­
ination ten thousand years hence than to loll in the immediate
and the imminent. With the years, they will have thought
more about time-in-itself than time passing, more about the
indefinite than the effective, more about the end of the
world than the end of a day. Knowing duration neither in
the extent of moments nor in privileged sites, they move
from failure to failure, and when even this progress is pro­
hibited, they stop, look in every direction, question the
horizon: there is no more horizon. . . . A nd that is when
they experience not vertigo but panic, a panic so powerful
106 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
that it erases their steps and prevents them from escaping.
They are men excluded, banished, men outlawed from time,
dis jointed from the rhythm that sweeps on the mob, men
victimized by an anemic and lucid will, struggling with itself,
endlessly listening to itself To will, in the fullest sense of
the word, is to be unaware that one wills, is to refuse to
loiter over the phenomenon of the will. The man of action
weighs neither his impulses nor his motives, still less does
he consult his reflexes: he obeys them without reflecting
upon them, and without hampering them. It is not action
in itself that interests him but its goal, its intention; similarly,
the object will attract him, and not the mechanism of the
will. At grips with the world, he seeks what is definitive in
it or hopes to put it there himself, right now or in two
years . . . . T o manifest oneself is to let oneself be blinded
by some form or other of perfection: not even movement
as such fails to contain a utopian ingredient. Even to breathe
would be a torture without the memory or anticipation of
paradise, supreme-and yet unconscious-object of our de­
sires, unformulated essence of our memory and our expec­
tation. Incapable of divulging it in the subsoil of their nature,
too hurried as well to be able to dig it out, we moderns
must project it into the future, and the epigraph of the Saint­
Simonian journal Le Producteur represents the shortcut of
all our illusions: "The golden age, which a blind tradition
located in the past, lies before us." Hence we are eager to
hasten its advent, to institute it for eternity, according to
an eschatology deriving not from anxiety but from exaltation
and euphoria, from a suspect and almost morbid greed for
happiness. The revolutionary thinks that the overthrow he
is preparing will be the last; all of us think the same thing
in the sphere of our activities: the ultimate is the obsession
The Golden Age 107
of the living. We bestir ourselves because it is up to us, we
think, to complete history, to close it, because it appears to
us as our domain, as does "truth" itself, emerging at last
from its chaste reserve to reveal itself. Error will be the fate
of others; only we shall have understood everything. Victor
over his kind, then over God, seeking to revise His work,
to correct its imperfections-anyone who has not tried as
much, who does not believe it is his duty to try, renounces
his own destiny, whether out of wisdom or weakness. Pro­
metheus sought to do better than Zeus; improvised demi­
urges, each of us tries to do better than God, to inflict upon
Him the humiliation of a paradise superior to His, to sup­
press the irreparable, to "defatalize" the world, borrowing
a word from Proudhon's jargon. In its general outline, utopia
is a cosmogonic dream on the level of history.
v
We shall not build paradise here on earth so long as men
are marked by Sin; hence we must release them from it,
liberate them. The systems that have been committed to
doing so participate in a more or less disguised Pelagianism.
Pelagius (a Celt, a naif), by denying the effects of the Fall,
deprived Adam's lie of any power to affect posterity. Our
first ancestor lived a strictly personal drama, incurred a dis­
grace that regarded him alone, without in any way knowing
the pleasure of bequeathing to us his flaws and misfortunes.
Born good and free, there is in us no trace of an original
corruption.
It is hard to imagine a doctrine more generous and more
untrue; this is a heresy of the utopian type, fruitful by its
108 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
very extravagances, by its absurdities which were rich in
futures. Not that the authors of utopias took their inspiration
from it directly; but it is incontestable that in modern thought
there exists, hostile to Augustinianism and to Jansenism, an
authentic current of Pelagianism-the idolatry of progress
and all revolutionary ideologies will be its conclusion-ac­
cording to which we constitute a mass of the virtual elect,
emancipated from original sin, infinitely malleable, predes­
tined to the good, capable of any and every perfection.
Robert Owen's manifesto promises us a system capable of
creating "a new spirit and a new will in the entire human
race, and thereby to lead each man, by an irresistible ne­
cessity, to become consistent, rational, healthy in judgment
and in conduct."
Pelagius, like his remote disciples, starts from a fiercely
optimistic vision of our nature. But there is no proof of any
kind that the will is good; it is even certain that it is anything
but, the new will equally with the old. Only men with a
deficient will are spontaneously good; the others must apply
themselves to being so, and succeed only at the cost of
efforts that embitter them. Evil being inseparable from ac­
tion, the consequence is that our undertakings are neces­
sarily directed against someone or something; at the limit,
against ourselves. But usually, I must insist, we will only at
someone else's expense. Far from being more or less elect,
we are more or less reprobates. If you want to construct a
society in which men do no harm to one another, you must
admit only abulics.
What we have is more than the choice between a sick
will and a bad one; the former excellent because stricken,
immobilized, ineffectual; the latter noxious and herice ac­
tive, invested by a dynamic principle: the very one that
The Golden Age 109
sustains the fever of becoming and provokes events. Take it
away from man, if you want a golden age! Which would be
as much as to strip him of his very being, whose entire secret
resides in that propensity to do harm, without which he is
inconceivable. Resistant to his own happiness and to that
of others, he acts as if he longed for the institution of an
ideal society; if it were achieved, he would smother in it,
the disadvantages of satiety being incomparably greater than
those of poverty. He loves tension, perpetual advance: to­
ward what would make his way within perfection? Unfit for
the eternal present, he dreads moreover its monotony, that
reef of paradise in its double form: religious and utopian.
Isn't history ultimately the result of our fear of boredom,
of that fear which will always make us cherish the novelty
and the spice of disaster, and prefer any misfortune to stag­
nation? An obsession with the unheard-of is the destructive
principle of our salvation. We head for hell to the degree
that we leave the vegetative life behind, that life whose
passivity would constitute the key to everything, the su­
preme answer to all our questions; the horror it inspires in
us has made us into that horde of civilized men, of omni­
scient monsters who know nothing of the essential. To be
bored in slow motion, to endure with dignity the injustice
of Being, to wrest ourselves away from expectation, from
the oppression of hope, to seek a middle term between
breathing and the corpse-we are all too corrupted and too
winded for that. There is no help for it: nothing will rec­
oncile us with boredom. Were we less rebellious to its sway,
we should know, by some succor from on high, a plenitude
without events, the pleasure of the invariable instant, the
delectation of identity. But such a grace is so contrary to
our nature that we are only too happy not to receive it.
110 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
Riven to diversity, we mine it for that constant quantity of
excesses and conflicts so necessary to our instincts. Released
from care and from all shackles, we should be delivered to
ourselves; the vertigo we would suffer then would leave us
a thousand times worse off than our servitude does. This
aspect of our failure escaped the anarchists, the last Pelagians
to date, who nonetheless were superior to their predeces­
sors in that they rejected, in their cult of freedom, every
city, beginning with the "ideal" ones, and substituted for
them a new variety of chimeras, more brilliant and more
improbable than the old. If they raged against the State and
demanded its suppression, it was because they saw it as an
obstacle to the exercise of a will that was fundamentally
good; now, it is precisely because the will is bad, is wicked,
that the State was born; if the State were to vanish, the will
would give itself up to evil without any restriction whatever.
Nonetheless, the anarchists' idea of annihilating all authority
remains one of the finest ever conceived. And we can never
sufficiently deplore the fact that the race of those who sought
to realize it is now extinct. But perhaps they had to fade,
to absent themselves from an age like ours, so eager to
invalidate their theories and their prophecies. They heralded
the era of the individual: the individual is drawing to his
close; they proclaimed the eclipse of the State: the State
was never stronger or more oppressive; they hailed the age
of equality: it is the age of terror which has come. Everything
runs down. Compared to theirs, even our crimes have de­
teriorated in quality: those we now and then still deign to
commit lack that atmosphere of the absolute which re­
deemed theirs, always executed with so much care and so
much brio! Is there anyone today willing to throw bombs
for the establishment of "the universal harmony," a capital
The Golden Age 111
fiction from which we no longer expect anything at all?
Besides, what could we hope from it, at the end of the iron
age we have come to? The prevailing sentiment now is dis­
illusion, the summa of our tainted dreams. And if we have
not even the resource of believing in the virtues of destruc­
tion, it is because we are all secularized anarchists today and
have understood not only their urgency but also their use­
lessness.

Suffering, in its early stages, counts on the golden age here
on earth, seeks a basis for it, attaches itself to it, in a sense;
but as suffering intensifies, it withdraws, attached only to
itself. Once an accomplice of utopian systems, it now rises
against them, discerning in them a mortal danger to the
preservation of its own pangs, whose charms it has just
discovered. With the voice of Dostoevsky's Notes from Un­
derground it will plead in favor of chaos, rise up against
reason, against "two and two equals four," against the "crys­
tal palace," that replica of the phalanstery.
He who has glimpsed the inferno, with its hierarchy of
woes, will recognize its terrible symmetry in the ideal city,
universal happiness, repugnant to anyone who has suffered
greatly: Dostoevsky vented his hostility to utopia to the
point of intolerance. As he grew older, he was to define
himself increasingly by an opposition to the Fourierist no­
tion of his youth: unable to forgive himself for having sub­
scribed to them, he took his revenge upon his own heroes,
superhuman . . . c aricatures of his first illusions. What he
loathed in them were his former divagations, the conces-
112 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
sions he had granted to utopia, many of whose themes were
to pursue him nonetheless: when, with the Grand Inquisitor,
he divides humanity into a happy herd and a ravaged, clear­
sighted minority which assumes the destinies of the others;
or when, with Verkhovensky, he tries to make Stavrogin
into the spiritual leader of the future city, an atheist and
revolutionary sovereign pontiff, the novelist takes his in­
spiration from the "priesthood" the Saint-Simonians set above
the "producers" or from Enfantin's plan to make Saint-Simon
himself the pope of the new religion. Dostoevsky links Ca­
tholicism to "socialism," he even identifies them, in a per­
spective that partakes of method and madness equally, an
eminently Slav melange. In relation to the West, everything
in Russia is heightened one degree: skepticism becomes
nihilism; hypothesis, dogma; idea, icon. Shigalev utters no
more lunacies than, say, Cabet, only he goes about it with
an intensity not to be found in his French model. "You have
no obsessions left, only we have any now," the Russians
seem to be telling the West through Dostoevsky, that ob­
sessive par excellence, partisan, like all his characters, of a
single dream: the dream of the golden age, without which,
he assures us, "peoples have no will to live, and cannot even
die." He himself does not expect its realization in history;
on the contrary, he dreads its advent, though without going
over to the "reaction," for he attacks "progress" in the name
not of order but of whim, of the right to caprice. After
having rejected the paradise to come, will he save the other
one, the old, the immemorial one? He will make it the
subject of a dream he attributes successively to Stavrogin,
to Versilov, and to "the ridiculous man."
"In the Dresden Gallery, there is a painting by Claude
Lorrain listed in the catalogue under the title Acts and Gal-
The Golden Age 113
atea . . . It was this picture that I saw in my dream, but not
.
as a picture-as a reality. There was a landscape from the
Greek archipelago, just as in the painting, and I seemed to
have moved back in time some three thousand years. Blue
waves gently lapping, rocks and islets, blossoming shores,
and in the distance, an enchanting panorama, the lure of the
setting sun . . . . H ere was the cradle of humanity . . . . M en
woke and fell asleep happy and innocent; the woods rang
with their joyous songs, and they expended their abundant
powers in making love, in simple pleasures. All this I ex­
perienced even as I discerned the enormous future which
lay ahead of them, and whose very existence they did not
suspect, and my heart shuddered at such thoughts." (The
Possessed)
Versilov, in his turn, will dream the same dream as Stav­
rogin, though with this difference, that the setting sun will
suddenly appear to him no longer as that of the beginning
but as that of the end of "European humanity." In A Raw
Youth, this picture is somewhat darkened; and altogether
darkened in "The Dream of a Ridiculous Man." The golden
age and its cliches are presented here with more exactitude
and spirit than in the two preceding dreams: a vision of
Claude Lorrain annotated by a Sarmatian Hesiod. We are
on the earth "before it was tainted by original sin." Men
lived there "in a kind of amorous fervor, universal and
reciprocal," having children but without knowing the hor­
rors of eroticism and childbirth, wandering through the woods
singing hymns and, plunged in a perpetual ecstasy, knowing
nothing of jealousy, anger, sickness, and so on. All of which
still sounds conventional enough. Fortunately for us, their
bliss which seemed eternal was, when put to the test, pre­
carious enough: "the ridiculous man" came among them and
114 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
perverted them all. With the appearance of evil, the cliches
vanish, the picture grows livelier: "Like a contagious disease,
an atom of plague capable of contaminating a whole empire,
even so I contaminated by my presence a blissful land in­
nocent until my advent. They learned to lie and delighted
in deceit, they learned the beauty of mendacity. Perhaps all
this began quite innocently, playfully, teasingly, as if it were
a kind of game, and in fact perhaps by means of some atom,
but this atom of lying made its way into their hearts and
they found it good, even lovable. Soon after, voluptuous
pleasure was born, and in turn engendered jealousy, and
jealousy cruelty . . . . O h, I don't know, I don't remember
any more, but soon, quickly enough, blood was shed in its
first jets and splashes: they were amazed, frightened, and
they began to avoid one another, to separate. Alliances were
formed, but now they were directed against the others. Re­
proaches and castigations were heard. They learned what
shame is, and of shame they made a virtue. The sense of
honor was born among them, and brandished its flag over
each alliance. They began to mistreat the animals, and the
animals left them for the depths of the forests, where they
lived hostile to mankind. An age of struggles began, favoring
separatism, individualism, personality, and the distinction
of mine and thine. There came to pass a diversity of lan­
guages. Men learned sadness and learned even to love it;
they aspired to suffering and said that the truth was to be
had by suffering alone. Having become wicked, it was then
that they began to speak of brotherhood and humanity, and
that they understood such ideas. Having become criminal,
it was then that they invented justice and handed down
codes of law in order to preserve it; then, in order to insure
respect for these codes, they instituted the guillotine. They
The Golden Age 115
had no more than a faint memory of what they had lost,
they would not even believe that once they had been in­
nocent and happy. They never tired of deriding the possi­
bility of their former happiness, which they called a dream."
(See A Writer's Diary.)
But there is worse: they were to discover that conscious­
ness of life is superior to life and the knowledge of the "laws
of happiness" superior to happiness. Henceforth, they were
lost; by dividing men against themselves by the demoniac
work of science, by casting them out of the eternal present
and into history, had not "the ridiculous man" reinvented
for them the errors and follies of Prometheus?
His crime perpetrated, he begins preaching-at the in­
stigation of remorse-a crusade for the reconquest of this
world of delights he has just destroyed. He commits himself
to it, but without conviction. Nor is the author convinced
either-at least such is our impression: having rejected the
formulas of the Future, he turns toward his preferred ob­
session, toward the age-old felicity, only to expose its in­
consistency and its phantasmagoria. Horrified by his discovery,
he will try to attenuate its effects, to revive his illusions, to
save, if only ideally, his dearest dream. He will not succeed,
as he knows, just as we know, and we do injustice to his
thought by declaring that it concludes with the double im­
possibility of paradise.
Moreover, is it not revealing that, in order to describe
the idyllic landscape of the three versions of the dream, he
has resorted to Claude Lorrain, whose insipid delights he
so prized, just as Nietzsche did? (What an abyss is supposed
by so disconcerting a predilection!) But the moment it is a
matter of depicting the disintegration of original felicity, the
decor and dizziness of the fall, he borrows nothing from
116 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
anyone, he mines himself, dismisses any alien suggestion;
he even stops imagining and dreaming-he sees. And at last
he finds himself in his element, at the heart of the iron age,
for the love of which he had battled against the "crystal
palace" and sacrificed Eden.
VII
When so authoritative a voice has taught us the fragility of
the former golden age and the nullity of the future one, we
must draw the consequences and no longer let ourselves be
deceived by Hesiod's divagations or by those of Prome­
theus, still less by that synthesis of them the utopias have
attempted. Harmony, universal or otherwise, has never ex­
isted and never will exist. As for justice, in order to believe
it possible, in order even to imagine it, we must have the
advantage of a supernatural talent for blindness, of an un­
precedented election, a divine grace reinforced by a diabolic
one, and count, further, on an effort of generosity from
heaven and hell alike, an effort, in truth, highly improbable
on the one side as on the other. According to Karl Barth,
we could not even "draw a breath of life if, deep within us,
there did not exist this certainty: God is just." Yet there
are those who still manage to live without knowing that
certainty, even without ever having known it. What is their
secret, and knowing what they know, by what miracle do
they still draw breath?
However pitiless our denials, we never quite destroy the
objects of our nostalgia: our dreams survive our waking and
our analysis. Though we have stopped believing in the geo­
graphical reality of paradise, and in its various figurations,
The Golden Age 117
it resides within us nonetheless, a supreme given, a dimen­
sion of our original ego; now che question is co discover ic
there. When we succeed, we enter into char glory che the­
ologians call essential; but ic is noc God we see face co face,
ic is che eternal present, wrested from becoming and from
eternity itself. . . . W hat does history matter from that mo­
ment-it is noc che seat of being, ic is ics absence, che no of
all things, che rupture of the living with themselves; not
being kneaded of che same substance as history, we refuse
co cooperate any further with ics convulsions. Lee ic crush
us, ic will affect only our appearances and our impurities,
chose vestiges of time we still drag behind us, symbols of
failure, scars of nondeliverance.
The remedy for all our ills muse be sought within our­
selves, in the timeless principle of our nature. If the unreality
of such a principle were proved, we should be lose without
hope of appeal. What proof could prevail, however, against
the intimate, impassioned conviction that some part of us
escapes duration, against che irruption of chose moments
when God coincides with a clarity suddenly appearing at
our limits, a beatitude which projects us far into ourselves,
a seizure outside the universe? No more past, no more
future; che centuries collapse, maccer abdicates, the shadows
are exhausted; death cums to ridicule, and ridiculous coo is
life itself. And chis seizure, even if we have experienced it
only once, would suffice co reconcile us with all our shames
and miseries, of which it is doubtless che recompense. It is
as if all time had come co visit us, for one final instance,
before disappearing. . . . N o use retracing the old paradise
or racing toward che one to come: che former is inaccessible,
the latter unrealizable. What matters, on the ocher hand, is
to internalize nostalgia or expectation, necessarily frustrated
118 HISTORY AND UTOPIA
when they venture outward, and to constrain them to di­
vulge, or to create within us, the happiness we respectively
regret or anticipate. No paradise unless deep within our
being, and somehow in the very heart of the self, the selfs
self; and even here, in order to find it, we must have in­
spected every paradise, past and possible, have loved and
hated them with all the clumsiness of fanaticism, scrutinized
and rejected them with the competence of disappointment
itself.
Let it be said that we substitute one ghost for another,
that the fables of the golden age are well worth the eternal
present we dream of, and that the original ego, basis of our
hopes, evokes the void and ultimately reduces itself to
it. . . . Yet a void that affords plenitude, a fulfilling void­
does it not contain more reality than all history possesses
from beginning to end?
